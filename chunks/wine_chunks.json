    "text": "The grape variety is what largely determines the style and quality of many wines, so it is common to name wines by their variety. But what exactly is a grape variety? The grape is the fruit of the vine and belongs to the Ampelidacea family. Winemakers are only interested in the Vitis gene belonging to this family, which is divided into several species. Of these, only one, Vitis vinifera, is the most important, since 99% of wines derive from this species. All well-known names such as Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot are varieties of Vitis vinifera.\n\nHowever, other members of the Vitis gene may play a small role in wine. Vitis Labrusca grapes are grown in the eastern states of the USA. As will be seen later in this chapter, hybrids of V. riparia, V. berlandieri and V. rupestris often provide rootstocks onto which stems of V. Vinifera. These species are of American origin, having been imported to Europe initially in the 19th century. Wine derived from this fruit generally has a distinctive flavor, described by many as “fox-like.”\n\n",

    "text": "The reproductive organs of the grape are located in the flowers. The grape has evolved as a species thanks to wind pollination and propagation by animals. So, although the flowers are small and insignificant, the fruit has a strong, sweet and attractive color. The flowers of almost all commercial grape varieties are hermaphrodite; they contain both male and female organs in the same flower. Sexual reproduction begins when the anthers (equivalent to testicles) mature and secrete pollen (equivalent to sperm). The pollen is carried by the wind and lands on the stigmas of other grape flowers. This is known as pollination. Pollen transfers its genetic material through a tube to the ovary, where it combines with the genetic material contained in the ovules during the fertilization process. The fertilized ovules will become seeds, and the ovary will become the skin that surrounds the grape. As with human reproduction, the seed will contain a selection of genetic material from both parents.",

Just as two dark-haired humans can produce a red-haired child, there is no reason to expect the cross to possess all the characteristics of the parents. Morio-Muskat, which produces very floral wines, has as parents Sylvaner and Pinot Blanc, both with a very neutral character. Once created, the cross results in a new variety and can only be propagated through grafting; like all other varieties, it cannot be duplicated. (Riesling has been crossed with Sylvaner on many occasions, always giving different results.) Some crosses such as Pinotage (Pinot Noir and Cinsault) in South Africa and Muller-Thurgau in Germany have long been established in the world's vineyards. Centers specializing in developing new varieties in this way include the University of California, Davis Campus and the Geisenheim Research Institute in Germany. The first of these focuses on creating high-yielding quality varieties, such as Ruby Cabernet (Cabernet Sauvignon and Carignan), which are well suited to the high temperatures of California's Central Valley. The second of these centres has created several aromatic varieties that achieve high sugar levels in cold climates, such as Morio-Muskat.\n\n",

It should be noted that a seed extracted, for example, from a Riesling grape will not develop into a Riesling vineyard, since the genetic instructions present in the seed will be as different from those of the vineyard as a baby's genes are from its mother. The only way to ensure that one vine has the same characteristics as another is to take a cutting and let it grow into a new vine. The equivalent in humans would be to extract a tissue sample and try to create a human clone of it. Although this is not yet possible with humans, plants have been cloned for hundreds of years. Over the centuries, unsuitable vines have disappeared and grafts of better quality vines have replaced them in the classic vineyards. Entire regions have been planted with grafts that theoretically come from the same layer. This is how the classic varieties initially originated.\n\n",

Although information is copied very accurately, there are occasionally errors known as mutations. These small changes can result in plants propagated through grafting having slight differences. Propagating a species through grafting is a form of cloning. The small differences that appear in the different varieties thanks to mutations during the cloning process are considered different clones of the same variety. Within a variety, some of the clones may possess natural characteristics, such as a particular flavor, high yields, or disease resistance. A viticulturist or nursery can select clones that contain the desired qualities for future propagation. A clone that meets all the desired characteristics may take several generations to develop. A good selection of clones is particularly important in older varieties such as Pinot Noir, whose immediate family includes members with very distinct characteristics.

The lice are easily transmitted, and the few wine-producing regions that were not affected now have to maintain very strict quarantine procedures. The phylloxera louse leaves wounds in the roots of the plant that facilitate the entry of bacteria and fungi, leading to diseases and, eventually over the years, to the death of the wine vines. American vines form protective layers beneath wounds, which prevents the damage from spreading. As the vine louse killed off vinifera vines, farmers were forced to look for a solution. First they tried to treat the vineyards, but it was not effective. They then planted American V. vines. labrusca, which were known to tolerate phylloxera. However, the wine they produced was of unacceptable quality. The next step was to try to reproduce the tolerance of American vines by crossing V.",

The task of creating rootstocks suitable for different types of soil and grape varieties has not been easy and research in this area is still ongoing. For some varieties, such as Folle Blanche (in Cognac), suitable rootstocks have not yet been found, which has resulted in these varieties tending to disappear in their traditional regions.\n\nThere are many regions of the world where phylloxera is not a problem, such as Chile, South Australia, and much of Argentina and Hungary.

Ungrafted vines are now more the exception than the rule.\n\nA grafted vine consists of two parts: an American root and a European graft. In the same way that the variety is selected, the rootstock is selected, which can offer different advantages, and it has to be suitable for the soil where it is planted.

Wine consumption is becoming more and more fashionable. For example, with the promotion of the Mediterranean diet and its benefits, the demand for red wine, particularly young red wine, increased. As a vineyard usually takes a minimum of three years to come into production, it can be very difficult to adjust to the rapid demands of the market. One solution is to use grafting on adult vines.

The best Chenin Blancs age extremely well, developing honeyed and toasty flavors.

In many regions, rainfall can be supplemented with irrigation, although until recently this was prohibited in vineyards in the European Union.\n\nAlthough wild vines grow abundantly throughout the world, commercial plantations of V. vinifera for wine production are concentrated mainly in two broad bands in the northern and southern hemispheres, approximately between 30º and 50º latitude. Here there is the ideal balance of heat and cold, sun and rain.

These effects are often subtle, but can sometimes be dramatic, and with careful production can be transformed into recognizable flavors and other aspects (such as tannins or acids) in a wine. Many of the characteristics of a wine that might once have been attributed to the region from which it originated are, strictly speaking, aspects of viticulture and winemaking.

Pruning is also done to control the number of buds - the determining factor that will affect the yield of the vineyard and the quality of the fruit.\n\nSummer pruning can be done for:\n\nRestrict vegetation to concentrate the vine's vigor on fruit production;\n\nTo control leaf mass so that the grape clusters have maximum exposure to the sun, or shade, as well as being well ventilated to reduce fungal infections;\n\nKeep the vineyard sufficiently maintained to facilitate work during the growing season and the harvest.\n\nBasically, there are two types of pruning: thumb pruning, in which shoots containing two to three buds are left on the vines, and cane pruning, where one or two long shoots containing eight to fifteen buds each are left (see illustration).\n\nPg.16: illustration.

Like gray rot, it tends to affect mostly unripe berries. Early spraying is recommended, although treatment should be completed before the grapes begin to ripen. It can seriously affect yields and quality. Under the right conditions - damp mornings and dry afternoons - this is the noble rot that makes the great sweet wines of Bordeaux, Germany and elsewhere. In its benign form, botrytis will affect ripe grapes by drawing water from the fruit through microscopic filaments that penetrate the pores of the skin. This causes the sugar to concentrate, reducing the grape into a raisin and adding its own unique flavors.

It attacks the wood of the vines through pruning cuts, causing part of the vine to rot and die, reducing yields, although it does not affect quality. An effective treatment has not yet been discovered.\n\nThe most serious bacterial disease is Pierce's disease, which is spread by small insects. It was first recognized in 1892, but to this day no effective cure has been found. An infected vineyard will die within five years. The most effective prevention seems to be to surround the vineyards with a sanitary cordon. Recently this disease has caused severe damage to vineyards in Mexico and Southern California.\n\nNumerous viruses can infect vines. Most do not kill the vine, but they reduce yield and quality. They are highly contagious and persistent, and are usually spread through wounds or by nematodes. Once established, they cannot be eradicated except by uprooting the vines and treating the soil for health reasons. Ideally, this soil should not be replanted with vines.

In the case of red wines, fermentation should begin at a temperature of 20 ºC, but will stop if the temperature rises to 35 ºC. This is why the fermentation temperature must be controlled. The ideal temperature varies depending on the grape variety and region.",

The ultimate goal of most red wines is to convert sugar into alcohol.\n\nApart from the traditional way of fermenting red wines, there are many other techniques.

The most traditional rosés produced in the EU are made using an abbreviated vinification of red wine, which involves macerating crushed grapes for one to three days before the pale-coloured juice is squeezed out to continue fermentation without the skins. The third method, known as saignée, requires the grapes to be destemmed, but not crushed, and placed in a barrel for 12 to 24 hours; the less contact, the paler the colour. The juice is extracted and fermented without contact with the skins. Sometimes only a portion of the juice is extracted, using the remainder to make a highly concentrated red wine. Rosés are usually fermented in tanks rather than vats and are bottled young. In the EU, with the exception of Champagne, it is prohibited to make quality rosés by mixing red and white wine.\n\nPg. 29, photo: Pumping over of wine is a method that helps to extract color and tannins in red wines.\n\n",

The grapes are pressed as soon as they arrive at the winery, since color and tannins are not necessary. However, there may be two or three hours of contact with the skins at a low temperature to give more flavor and fruit. The juice is extracted from the pressing and placed in vats or containers, where it is allowed to ferment. Fermentation typically occurs at low temperatures (between 15ºC and 20ºC, sometimes as low as 9ºC) and for longer than for red wine. This is done to enhance the fruit flavors of the wine and not lose freshness. Since fermentation produces heat, the wort may sometimes need to be cooled. In a modern winery, this process happens automatically, as each barrel has its own heat/cold system. If fermentation occurs at too low a temperature, this can lead to pear aromas and the inability to extract varietal fruits from the grape skins. Fermentation at higher temperatures can contribute to the formation of more complex aromas, but there is a risk that the characteristics of the varietal fruits will dissipate.\n\nIf the wine is barrel fermented, the lees will be stirred regularly to give the wine more flavor and richness. Many winemakers produce white wine fermented in new oak. Once fermentation is complete, the wine will be transferred to clean containers to prevent spoilage due to prolonged contact with the lees.\n\n",

The best sweets come from grapes with a high sugar content due to the concentration of botrytis; or from grapes that are in the process of drying (passito); or from grapes that have been frozen on the vines and from which the water has been extracted. Fermentation stops naturally once the yeasts have converted as much sugar as possible into alcohol. This is the case for wines such as Sauternes and Tokaji Aszu, which have an alcohol content of between 13-14% vol., and for wines such as German Trockenbeerenausleses and Eisweins which can be 7% vol. If the fermented must is filtered using a membrane so fine that it is able to remove all the yeast before all the sugar has been consumed, the result will be a sweet wine.

The changes that a wine undergoes during the maturation period can be divided into three categories. First, the container in which the maturation takes place can add components to the wine, for example the tannins and toasty flavors that are present in new oak barrels. Second, some chemical reactions require the presence of oxygen; these include those that promote the caramel, coffee, and dried fruit flavors in muscatel liqueurs and tawny ports. These flavors will also contribute to the complexity of wines such as barrel-aged Chardonnays and Bordeaux reds. Whether or not to age the wine in barrels is the decision of the winemaker. Generally, the better the wine, the greater the need for the use of barrels, especially new barrels. The third category covers the development of flavours that can only take place in an inert, oxygen-free environment such as a glass bottle.

This can spread from one barrel to another, so it must be prevented by using doses of sulfur dioxide, which combined with oxygen neutralizes the acetobacter. To prevent potential problems, microorganisms are killed by the use of sulfur dioxide or heat. Pasteurization, normally used for red wines, is an example of this. This is achieved by a system that raises the temperature of the wine to 95 ºC for one second (flash system). This system is widely used by many winemakers in areas such as Beaujolais, where large volumes of wine with a stable consistency are required.

Cork producers have invested large sums in implementing treatments to prevent these problems. Artificial corks, made of plastic, have been developed to replace and give an acceptable result in wines that do not need aging. For longer aging periods, artificial cork does not offer sufficient protection against oxygen, although studies are underway to remedy this problem. The third alternative, which initially received a lot of support for white wines from Australia and New Zealand, and is now being used increasingly around the world, even for red wines, is the screw cap. In this case there will be a protective layer of inert gas between the wine and the cork.\n\nPg. 34, Photo: Cork freshly removed from the tree.",

    "text": "For a time after bottling, wine may suffer from what is known as “bottle sickness,” meaning the wine neither smells nor tastes as it should. Most wines are bottled for immediate consumption. Aging can result in the loss of fresh fruit flavors. There are, however, many wines that improve after having aged in bottles for several months or even years. Examples of this include vintage Port, fine German Rieslings, Bordeaux Cru Classé, as well as the finest red and white Burgundy wines, which do not reach their peak until they have spent at least 20 years or more in bottle. The laws of some countries, such as Italy and Spain, insist that certain wines not be put on the market until they have aged a minimum number of years in the bottle. It is vital that the ageing time takes place in a dark, dry and cool place, without disturbance and at a constant temperature, ideally between 12-13 ºC. There must also be constant humidity. Bottles should be stored horizontally so that the corks remain moist and retain their sponginess to seal the bottle optimally.\n\n",

Weight adds to shipping costs, and its rigidity means it is not possible to make the most of space when packing it. Adding to the disadvantages is the fact that once a glass bottle is opened, the half-empty part leaves room for air to enter, which in turn will attack the wine if it is not sucked out or replaced by an inert gas such as nitrogen.\n\nPlastic bottles and bags are much lighter and are pressed once the wine has been consumed, thus eliminating air penetration. Unfortunately, the plastic used is not inert like glass, and since it is permeable, the wine decays in a few months. In most cases this is not a problem as many wines are produced with immediate consumption in mind. However, glass is the best option when you want to age and store wine.\n\n",

Red wines should be served at room temperature, assuming the tasting room is not too hot. Wines can be decanted before tasting. There may be a number of reasons for this: to separate the wine from possible deposits in the bottle, to allow it to breathe, or, in some cases, to prevent premeditated judgements based on the label or shape of the bottle. The order in which the wines are tasted is also important, so that the palate is not influenced by what has been tasted previously. For white wines, dry ones will come before sweet ones. With reds it is a little more difficult. There are those who think that older wines should be tasted before younger ones because they tend to be more delicate. There are others who will always start with the youngest wines and work their way back in age. White wines are generally tasted before red wines. The best order is the one the taster feels most comfortable with.\n\nIt is also worth remembering, within the context of serious analytical tasting, that most wines are made to be consumed with food. As an example of this, many Spanish and Italian red wines consumed individually are aggressive, but when paired with local cuisine, which is highly dependent on olive oil, they become more appealing.\n\n",

These usually suggest high alcohol content or a lot of residual sugar. Similarly, very sweet white wines may appear “oily” in the glass. Occasionally in white wines there may be a deposit of crystals that look like sugar. These are tartrates that have been deposited in cold climates; they do not affect the quality of the wine. In fact, one German producer calls them “wine diamonds” – something highly valued in wine as it shows that it is natural. Sometimes bubbles may appear in a wine that is supposed to be still and not sparkling. In some white wines designed to be drunk young a slight CO2 may remain in the wine to help preserve its freshness. In fact, in Portuguese Vinho Verde, it can be artificially introduced at the time of bottling. On the other hand, it may indicate that a second fermentation has begun in the bottle.",

Generally speaking, a long, slow fermentation in the bottle produces the smallest, finest bubbles. However, when we examine the bubbles in the glass, much can depend on how the glass has been washed. Even tiny amounts of detergent or grease can prevent bubbles from forming, and variations in glass texture can lead to large differences in bubble size, speed and regularity.

While one may reject a wine at this stage, one is unlikely to accept it without further confirmation from the other senses. There are many tasters who consider the sense of smell when making a judgment. To release all the aromas of a wine, it must be swirled inside the glass. To release these odors effectively, it may be necessary to warm the cup by placing it between the palms of your hand.\n\nThe first point to consider when smelling a wine is its condition. Is it clean or not-clean? Experienced tasters will often appreciate a wine with caution, sniffing it lightly. Then, if all is well, they will swirl the wine around the glass and take a deeper sniff. The most common defect that can be detected at this stage is the cork smell. It has been estimated that 5% of all wines are affected by this.",

Even if the smell in the nose is elusive, it is generally more pronounced in the mouth. It has nothing to do with the cork particles that may be found in your glass. These can be removed with your fingers or by simply pushing the cup away. Excess SO2 is perhaps the most aggressive of odors and is most often found in inexpensive white wines. It is used as a preservative and to destroy yeast in wines with residual sugar. When used in excess, it can give the wine a pungent smell like burnt matches.

A wine affected by oxidation is often described as “maderized,” with a burnt smell like that of Madeira wines, or caramel. It can generally be recognized visually as the wines have a brownish, unnatural color and a dull appearance. Volatile acidity generates aromas like nail polish and vinegar, caused by the presence of acetic bacteria and oxygen together. A wine with this smell should be rejected immediately.\n\nThe next step is to decide the intensity of the aroma, which can give us clues about the quality of the wine. A weak nose may indicate a tasteless wine; fine wines usually have a more intense nose although they may appear “closed” when young. A healthy and expressive nose is always a good sign.

A five-year-old Bordeaux Cru Classé may be in its infancy, while a five-year-old Beaujolais is most likely past its prime. So while some wines may seem tired on the nose at just three years old, others may still be youthful at thirty. In the technical vocabulary of tasting, the aromas generally used to describe young wines are derived from the fruit itself, while the term bouquet applies to an assortment of aromas that come from the aging of the wine, particularly in the bottle.\n\nThe final stage is to describe the character of the aromas.",

At the end of this chapter we include the WSET systematic approach to wine tasting, which includes suggestions as to the words we can use to describe aromas, and how these can be classified. With practice we can learn to associate certain aroma combinations with very specific grape varieties, regions and even, sometimes, individual vineyards. It should be noted that although many sweet wines have a distinctive nose, sugar is not volatile, and therefore cannot be detected by the sense of smell.

It is amazing how a wine opens up in this way as its volatile components are released. There are a large number of elements in wine that are detected through the physiological reactions of the wine on the taste buds in the mouth. Different aspects of a wine's taste can be appreciated by the reactions of different parts of the mouth, tongue and gums.

Châteaux that have built a reputation for their wines can sell them year after year without difficulty, although the price they achieve may vary from year to year. However, these Châteaux account for only a small proportion of the total market, leaving large quantities of wine waiting to be sold. Many retailers believe that the future lies in brands, but few of them have the facilities to create them and compete in global markets. Added to this is the fact that Bordeaux wines generally need to age to enhance their quality, as when young they do not possess those rich fruit aromas and flavours like New World wines. Few consumers have the patience or time to store a wine for years before being able to consume it. Unfortunately, many wine producers and sellers do not want to go through the trouble of storing wines correctly or cannot wait until the time of buying and selling to recover their money.",

For example, Château Petrus in Pomerol has increased in size by around 50% since 1969. The name of a château is more of a brand than a specific designation. There are more than 3,000 individual châteaux in Bordeaux vineyards, although until recently only a small proportion appeared on labels.

The season in which the fruit ripens features long hours of sunlight, but these are moderated by a maritime climate. For this reason, frost is not usually a problem, although it has occasionally caused severe damage, as in April 1991. Humidity is high, not only because of the proximity of the sea, but also because of the rivers that pass through this region. This promotes noble rot and grey rot, a major problem for red wines. The strong winds coming from the Atlantic are cushioned by pine forests and mountain dunes. Because they are located in a temperamental climate zone, Bordeaux vintages can vary considerably from year to year. A thorough knowledge of the differences between individual vintages is very important, although for the finest wines, strict selection of grapes and barrels as well as the use of secondary wines considerably reduces the differences in style and quality between vintages.\n\n",

Finally, the main districts to the north and east of the Gironde and the Dordogne are Saint-Emilion and Pomerol. The AC hierarchy in Bordeaux consists of three levels: generic, district, and communal.\n\nGeneric Appellations are names applied to AC wines produced anywhere in Gironde, such as Bordeaux and Bordeaux Supérieur.\n\nDistrict appellations may be the highest appellation that can be acquired in a locality, as is the case of Entre-Deux-Mers; or they may incorporate a number of higher communal appellations as is the case of Haut-Médoc.\n\nCommunal Appellations are the highest appellations in Bordeaux, except in the particular case of Saint-Emilion Grand Cru AC.\n\nThe names of the châteaux are not part of any AC. For example, Château Latour has the Pauillac AC and Château Climens has the Barsac AC. Given the high number of châteaux, quality classification scoring systems grew over the years, and in some cases, before the establishment of the Appellation Controlée.

(To make things easier for small owners, mobile bottling plants are now common.) In addition, outside France, Bordeaux is no longer considered the world centre of wine, whose wines must be purchased. Competition, especially from the New World, has been very strong in export markets and Bordeaux has been slow to react. While sales of generic wines were declining, those of petits châteaux were increasing. They are now in decline. Is branded wine the answer?\n\nMany of the traditional traders have disappeared or have been absorbed.",

These wines are then aged in new French oak barrels which add meaty and toasty flavours to the wine, as well as complexity from the rich black fruits and spices.

On the other hand, in Burgundy, the name of the vineyard is attached to the name of the land, which is registered in each town hall. The size rarely changes. Each Premier Cru and Grand Cru vineyard has its own AC. Because of this, while Bordeaux has approximately 60 names protected under the CA system, Burgundy has more than 10 times that number, yet its vineyard area and total production are less than half that of its notorious rival.",

More than half of the total production of the four regions is white wine and a quarter is red; almost 12% is rosé; the rest is sparkling.\n\nDue to the length of the river, there are climatic variations between different regions. In Nantais and Anjou, the dominant influence comes from the Atlantic Ocean. Upriver the climate becomes more continental. However, the Loire and its tributaries moderate the climatic conditions.

With the arrival of the railways in the second half of the 19th century, this region became the source where French consumers quenched their thirst for wine of any quality. In the warehouses of the ports, for example in Sète, the strong wines (which quickly went to one's head) from the French colonies in North Africa were mixed with weaker wines from the Languedoc. The loss of these colonies and the entry of France into the common market, together with competition from the Italian wine market, led to the collapse of the economy based on wine monoculture. However, it was the EU funds that enabled the economy to revive. Vineyards have been uprooted and orchards planted. High-yielding varietals, such as Aramon, are no longer used. To satisfy a global market that drinks less but insists on better quality, more attractive wines must be produced.\n\nHere, since the collapse of the market for basic table wines, two processes have occurred that have developed in parallel: the rise of several VDQS wines to AC, and the rise in importance of Vins de Pays.\n\nPg.83, graphic: Languedoc-Roussillon.\n\n",

Consequently, there have been many plantings of “foreign” varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Chardonnay and Viognier. At first, Vins de Pays used smaller names from the region, such as Vin de Pays des Côteaux de Peyriac, but this had no meaning for the consumer. Furthermore, departmental names, such as Vin de Pays de l'Aude, were considered very anonymous. This led to the creation of Vin de Pays d'Oc, which covers all the vineyards of Roussillon as well as Languedoc, Gard, Hérault, Ayde and Pyrénées-Orientales. To obtain this status, the wines must pass a tasting panel.\n\nThe Vin de Pays concept has been quite popular in export markets such as Germany and Great Britain. The system allows a lot of freedom in winemaking, which has led to a lot of experimentation and the injection of foreign capital. Because there is so much flexibility, wine prices vary considerably, and are often more expensive than those of their neighbors with, in theory, better AC.\n\nPg.84, photo: Limestone soils behind wire-trained Syrah vineyards in Corbières, just before harvest.\n\n",

They were always low in alcohol, and almost without exception had residual sugar. If a German wanted to drink wine with his meal, instead of choosing German wine or beer, he would choose a French wine. To counteract this problem, in the early 1980s many farmers began producing dry wines. Today, almost half of the wine consumed nationwide is dry (trocken) or semi-dry (halbtrocken). For those consumers who were accustomed to traditional German wines, these changes seem a bit shocking. Another historical problem has been the great fragmentation of the large agricultural complexes, which has had the same effect that the division of the lands belonging to the church and the imposition of Napoleonic inheritance laws had in Burgundy. To counter this problem, successive German governments have implemented a redistribution of land to facilitate work. However, one negative effect of this has been that many vineyards have been planted on land that is not suitable for the production of quality wines.\n\nGerman wines are often misunderstood and underappreciated, and it's not hard to see why. Germany produces some of the finest wines in the world, but the existence of uninteresting and sugary bulk wines deters many wine lovers from trying the best quality wines.\n\n",

With the exception of Baden in southern Germany, all other vineyards are located in EU climate zone A. Despite the low temperatures, Germany's continental climate provides warm summers, although these are followed by cold winters. Rain falls throughout the year, with July and August being the months when it rains the most. Frost in late spring is often a danger, as is heavy rain and hail storms in summer. Within these frameworks, patterns vary considerably from year to year, giving rise to large differences in quality and quantity between vintages. The combination of heat and rain during the summer results in high yields, which must be controlled. On the contrary, the long, dry autumns facilitate the production of high-quality late-harvest wines. The grapes are able to ripen slowly and develop rich, complex flavors. In good vintages, the climate favours the development of noble rot (Edelfäule). Under such marginal conditions there can be enormous differences in the qualities of wines from different vineyards. The best vineyards are planted on steep slopes to make the most of the available sun. Due to the climate, the majority of wines produced in Germany are white wines, although there is an increase in the production of quality red wines.\n\n",

When certain levels of production have been reached, new laws have come into effect. This took place for the first time in 1987, when cultivation reached 500 hectares and preparations began to be made for the creation of an appeal system. This came into effect in the 1991 vintage and became known as the Quality Wine Scheme (QWS). Under this scheme, wines that were accepted after being evaluated and tasted, that were made from 100% vinifera grapes, and that met certain standards, could be labeled as English (or Welch) Vineyards Quality Wine. The disadvantage for many was that wines made from a variety as widely cultivated as Seyval Blanc could not be included. As a result, a new category called RWS (Regional Wine Scheme) was introduced in 1996, equivalent to the Vin de Pays in France, thus allowing wines of any varietal to be evaluated.",

In the late 1980s, the best-selling red wine in Britain was Cabernet Sauvignon from Bulgaria, and in 1996 Bulgaria became the second largest exporter of bottled wine in the world. With the collapse of government control over the industry, the infrastructure crumbled, resulting in a decline in sales and pushing Bulgarian wine to the bottom shelves of supermarkets. Since then, a large amount of foreign capital has been invested in wineries, but much less has been invested in vineyards. This has resulted in a dramatic drop in yields, with total production down by a third. Many foreign winemakers now work in the country and there has been a slow improvement in quality. A large part of the vineyards are small independent entities, which means that wine production is in the hands of large wineries, some cooperatives and others private.\n\n",

Fortunately, and perhaps in a simplistic way, they can be grouped into two large groups, which can be related to their ancestral Greek and Etruscan roots.\n\nIn central and north-eastern Italy, vines have traditionally been trained at altitude. The Etruscans used natural supports such as olive trees, fig trees and walnut trees. The planting density was low and, with minimal pruning of the vineyard, yields were high. When grapes were not given more importance than any other crop, this inefficient method was acceptable. Today, as a result of the quest for quality, these methods have virtually disappeared. This Etruscan influence remains, however, in the high conduction systems still in use in north-eastern Italy.\n\nThe Greeks planted vineyards with very low densities, restricted yields and high quality fruit. In the northwest and south, this system has historically been favoured and cable training systems such as the espalliera (spalliera) and Guyot are still used. When it comes to quality, the vast majority of new vineyards use one of these two systems anywhere in Italy. However, in the south where the climate is dry and hot with less risk of rot, there is a tendency to plant vines in goblet (alvarello).\n\n",

Volcanic soils are ideal for the production of good wines. Sadly, quality levels have since declined, and it is only in recent years that a very small number of producers have attempted to recreate the quality of the past.\n\nTaurasi is a red wine, made from the high-quality grape called Aglianico, which has been promoted to the DOCG category. The Aglianico grape has a very thick skin that retains its acidity, allowing it to be harvested very late after very complex aromas have had time to develop. Along with Nebbiolo, this is one of the latest-ripening grapes in Italy and produces full-bodied, tannic wines with good acidity and flavors of black plums and smoky spices. These wines need aging. A minimum of three years is required before sale, of which at least one must be in barrel.\n\n",

The latter is used to make full-bodied red wines, with high alcohol content and spicy berry aromas. Almost all of these belong to the IGT category.\n\nThere are two DOCs with little more than local notoriety, which are Salice Salentino and Copertino; both wines can be of a medicinal, Port-like intensity and are made from the Negroamaro grape with a little help from Malvasia Nera.\n\n",

Columnella, who was the author of one of the oldest and most detailed Roman texts on winemaking, belonged to a family that owned vineyards in what is now known as Cádiz. At that time, Spain was one of the largest producers of wine for Rome. Since Spain joined the European Union, there have been more changes in the wine industry than in all the past centuries. Modernisation has come at a rapid pace, and this has been reflected not only in the vineyards and wineries, but also in legislation. Everything is constantly changing and talking about the Spanish wine industry now is like taking a snapshot of a particular moment. Spain has a larger area of vineyards than France or Italy, yet its annual production is much lower than that of either of them. The reason is that many of the vineyards are planted sparsely and the harvests are poor due to the age of the vines and a very arid climate.\n\n",

This hilly region has a soil known as llicorella, which consists of layers of red slate, with tiny particles of mica that sparkle in the sun and reflect heat. Traditional Priorat is a red wine with a very high alcohol content and is made from low-yield Garnacha and Cariñena vines. Many were aged for long periods in oak, sometimes in a solera, and began to develop musty aromas (gamey and mushroom-like). However, it is modern wines made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Pinot Noir, in addition to traditional Garnacha and Cariñena, that have raised the profile of this region, resulting in the granting of DOC status. When young, modern wines display intense blackberry fruit with secondary flavors of new oak. Strong tannins and massive fruit extract give these wines great, long aging potential.\n\nPg.125, photo: New vineyards in Priorat.",

The soil of this region is rich in calcium carbonate and has a continental climate with cool summer nights. The traditional grape of the region is Verdejo, which produces wines of surprising elegance, as the cool nights favor the development of aromatic flavors while retaining acidity. Sauvignon Blanc and Viura are also used. Modern winemaking techniques, such as night harvesting and low-temperature fermentation under inert gas to prevent contact with air, preserve the natural fruity aromas of these varieties.

Another advantage has been the loss of importance experienced by cooperative wineries while, at the same time, individual ownership, or quinta, is gaining ground.

What can be even more confusing is that the same name can be used to describe different varietals depending on the region where they are found.

During that time, Governor Simon van der Stel was planting his own vineyards in Constantia, in the shadow of Table Mountain. Historically most of the grapes planted in South Africa were used in the production of brandy and fortified wines. There are currently some 108,000 hectares of vineyards, with only one-ninth planted specifically with grapes for distillation, although many of the other plantings can be considered dual-purpose.

A bottle receives a certification seal on the label only after it has been tasted by an independent panel, this guarantees the veracity of the information appearing on the label. If a vintage is specified, 75% of the wine must come from that particular year. If a variety (known locally as a cultivar) is specified, 75% must consist of that variety. The variety and vintage specified must make up 85% of the wine for those sold in the EU, but 100% of the grapes must come from the specified production area. The smallest production area recognised within the Wine of Origin legislation is the Estate (see the Producers section). Groups of farms form Wards (such as Franschoek, Constantia), which are grouped into Districts (Paarl, Stellenbosch, Overberg). The largest area of recognized production is the Region. Not all Districts are part of a Region, and not all Wards are part of a District. This results in the production boundaries of each area being very confusing.

She became so powerful that she oversaw all sales of all wines at all levels. Recently, this cooperative has been privatized and has to compete with other producers. This appears to have revived trade, although it also means that winegrowers no longer have a guaranteed price for their grapes. The result is that this will lead to an improvement in quality.\n\nThere are now three types of wine producers in South Africa. First there are the cooperative wineries, which are responsible for most of the wine produced. They have recently invested a lot of capital in machinery. Some of them market their own wines, while others sell them in bulk to large merchants. Recent developments have led to a rapid expansion in the number of estate wineries. These can only produce wines from grapes grown on their own land, and many of them already have a well-established reputation. Finally, there are a small number of independent wholesalers who purchase grapes and wines to sell under their own labels.

These qualities can be combined in a blend from different regions. Shiraz is also used to add softness and lightness to blends with Cabernet Sauvignon, playing a similar role to Merlot in Bordeaux. Historically, this allowed a wine with the characteristics of Cabernet Sauvignon to be produced in larger quantities at lower prices. Today this mixture survives thanks to its own merits. (It should be noted that in the 19th century, Syrah from Hermitage was added to the best Bordeaux wines to give them more body and flavour.",

Most Australian Chardonnay goes through some oak, either through the use of chips, staves or fermentation and barrel ageing. However, unaoaked Chardonnays are becoming increasingly common.

This is because the government does not have subsidies available for planting new vineyards, but it does have subsidies for replanting vineyards that are destroyed by this disease.\n\n",

This wine is considered a world reference point. Its intense aromas focus on green pepper, freshly cut grass, and elderflower, but can include passion fruit, mineral notes, and traces of oak. The best quality wines, with their intense concentrated fruit aromas and high acidity levels, are capable of developing asparagus notes as they age in bottle. The most planted grape is Chardonnay. As in other New World countries, all options (such as the use of oak, malolactic fermentation, aging on lees, etc.) are explored with this variety, leading to different styles. Wines from Gisborne tend to exhibit riper, more exotic fruit than those from Marlborough and Central Otago. They all tend to have a pure, clean fruit character and fresh acidity.",

Much later, waves of English, Dutch and French immigrants attempted to plant vineyards along the sea in the east, but were unsuccessful. It was not until the early part of the 19th century that immigrants to Ohio, mostly German, managed to form a thriving wine industry dependent on native vines. Now, there are vineyards, of major or minor importance, in all 50 states of the USA. Some are from European varietals that are grafted onto American roots, others produce wines from American varietals that descend from the original wild vines, and others are hybrids. The most important centers of the wine industry are California, the Pacific Northwest (Washington, Oregon, and Idaho), and New York State. Canada and Mexico also produce wine. In Canada, the main vineyards are located in Ontario, on the Niagara Peninsula and in southern British Columbia in the Okanagan Valley; in Mexico, they are located in Baja California.\n\n",

In 1978, this agency established the American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) system to supplement an existing appellate system; the resulting scheme continues to be developed. The AVA guarantees the authenticity of the place of origin but does not guarantee quality or production. Anyone can request an AVA, of any size. This means that some AVAs only have one winery. If the AVA appears on the label, at least 85% of the wine must have been produced with grapes grown in that area. Recently, certain aspects previously controlled by the BATF have become the responsibility of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.\n\nState laws vary considerably from state to state. For example, Oregon requires that most of its varietal wines contain 95% of the varietal listed on the label, Washington requires 85%, and California, and most other states, requires 75%. On the other hand, there is New York State, which, mostly for climatic reasons, allows its winemakers to label as regional wine something that may have added up to 35% sugar and water, as well as 25% wine from somewhere else. In the past, much American wine was labeled with generic names like Burgundy or Chablis, but the rise of varietal wines and the glut of wine on the market has led to their disappearance, even in the domestic market.\n\n",

However, there was an increase in demand for grapes for the production of “grape juice” at home, which kept many vineyards afloat.

In addition to this, he has two individual and particular problems. The first problem is phylloxera; a careless study conducted at the Davis campus led to the widespread use of the AXR-1 graft, which turned out not to be resistant to phylloxera, so more than half of Napa Valley's vineyards had to be replanted. More recently, Pierce's disease has spread from orange groves in Southern California. This disease is carried by insects called “sharpshooters” and is incurable and fatal for the vineyard. Although it is possible to create a cordon sanitaire to combat the problem, it does not solve the root of the situation.\n\n",

On each conquistador ship came a priest who brought with him the Bible and vine shoots for the mass wine. The first vines were planted in what is now the Dominican Republic around 1493, and this invasion is believed to have come to an end with the construction of the mission in Sonoma California in 1823. The importance of production in the New World can be judged by the fact that the governments of Spain and Portugal prohibited the production of wine in the American colonies, except for mass, in order to protect domestic growers. The further the colonies were from the mother country, the more difficult it was to enforce laws, and Peru became the dominant centre of production in the Americas, with an area of vineyards three times larger than it is today. In the early 19th century, two factors drove the current industry in South America: the fall of the Spanish Empire, and social unrest in Europe that led to thousands of people emigrating to the New World. The Portuguese, Italians and Spanish who settled in South America brought with them their need to incorporate wine into their daily diet and planted vines around their homes that they would use for personal consumption.\n\nPg. 161, map: South America\n\n",

This resulted in production being concentrated on four varieties: Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot for reds and Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc for whites.

Similarly, per capita wine consumption is half that of its peak of 91.75 litres per year in 1970. Since an open economy was not established until 1990, there was no money available to invest in wineries or vineyards. However, since then there has been considerable investment, led by Chileans.

Legend would have us believe that Champagne was invented by Don Perignon, a monk who was a cellar master in Hautvillers in 1668. However, six years earlier, Dr. Christopher Merret had described how English coopers added sugar to still wines to make them sparkling. By the mid-1660s, there was a strong demand in London for “strong and sparkling” wines. At the same time, the refugee Marquis de Saint Evremont had made still Champagne wines popular at court. Fashion dictated that the two should be combined, and only in London were the components necessary for the sale of sparkling wines, solid glass bottles and cork stoppers, found. These did not arrive in France until 25 years later. Bubble induction takes place in a separate process, so any wine can be transformed into sparkling wine. During the 19th century, products such as Clos de Vougeot Mousseaux and sparkling Sauternes could be found.\n\nToday there are three basic ways to add bubbles to a wine: through a secondary fermentation in the bottle; a secondary fermentation in the tank; and carbonation.\n\nBOTTLE FERMENTATION\n\n",

Many New World sparkling wines specify the vintage, but a small percentage of reserve wines can still legally be used.

In the Meunier Valley, all three varieties are found, although Pinot Meunier is the preferred one. Its late budding and early ripening make this grape grow better in this Nordic climate with spring frosts and summer rainfall. It gives an easy-drinking fruitiness, and is especially important for wines that are to be enjoyed when young. The Montagne de Reims part is widely planted with red varieties, especially Pinot Noir. This varietal produces full-bodied, long-lasting wines and provides a base for most blends. In the Côte des Blancs, Chardonnay is the most common. It produces a much lighter wine than Burgundy and is counted on to impart acidity, floral and citrus characters, light body and very fine-textured bubbles.\n\nThe vineyards are arranged in rows with a maximum separation distance of 1.5 metres. Individual vineyards are planted at a distance of 0.9-1.5 metres apart. Different pruning methods are permitted, although the best-category vineyards use Taille Chablis (for Chardonnay) or Cordon de Royat (for Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier). Both methods leave large amounts of old wood, which increases frost resistance, and makes it easier to grow a second crop in years when frost has destroyed the first shoots. In both cases, the vines are trained on low wires that are thumb pruned.\n\n",

The word Cava is a DO (currently in the process of promotion to DOC), and covers the method and area of production. The trade is centered in the town of Sant Sadurni d'Anoia, where the wineries compete with those of Champagne. While the majority of wine is produced in the Catalan vineyards of Penedés, production can also take place in other DO regions: These include Rioja, Navarra and Utiel-Requena. The wines must be made using the traditional method and must remain in the bottle for a minimum of nine months before being disgorged. The cork should have a four-pointed star at the base.\n\nMost Cava tends to be dry and low in acidity, with some character from the autolysis of the yeasts. The flavor will vary considerably depending on the grapes used. In Penedés, the most commonly used varieties are those usually planted locally for white wines. Macabeo (the Viura from Rioja) produces fairly neutral wines. Xarel-lo can have an intense, earthy flavor. Parellada exhibits apple notes. Many producers are beginning to use Chardonnay, which can provide the necessary fruit and acidity. Unlike Champagne, few wines are made for aging.\n\nPg. 176, chart: Sparkling Wine Tank Method.\n\n",

    "text": "It is mainly to the countries of the New World that Champagne houses have gone to diversify. Under several joint and independent initiatives, good quality sparkling wines are being produced using not only the traditional method. Most good New World sparkling wines are made from Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, so they require vineyards in cooler climates in regions such as Tasmania and the Yarra Valley in Australia, Marlborough in New Zealand, Carneros in California and Oregon. Although Champagne varietals and methods are used, the wines tend to have richer, riper fruit. However, the variety of vineyards, and the different philosophies about wine production and commercial objectives, result in a diversity of styles when it comes to matters such as degrees of autolysis, fruit character, and the balance between fruit and oxidative flavors and/or acidity. There is often considerable investment in the vineyards and production mechanics, and quality can be exceptional. Many of the major brands are produced using labor-saving techniques, such as the transfer method, which reduces costs and increases profitability.\n\nSparkling Reds are made with different varietal grapes from Australia, although Shiraz is undoubtedly the most important. Some use a proportion of reserve wines and/or barrel aging to add intensity and complexity.\n\nThere are also large quantities of very cheap sparkling wines made in New World regions that do not use Champagne varietals. They use the tank method.\n\n",

In France, this method is known as cuve close, or the Charmat method, named after the Frenchman who invented it in the early 20th century. According to this method, the second fermentation takes place in a sealed tank instead of in a bottle. Dry base wine is introduced into the tank, along with sugar, yeast nutrients and clarifying agents. After the second fermentation, the remaining sediment is removed by filtration under pressure, before the wine is bottled.\n\nThe most important advantage of the tank method is that it considerably reduces production costs. It does, however, tend to produce larger, more irregular bubbles that do not last as long as those from bottle-fermented wine. It is also true that most wines that undergo this method do not show any of the subtle flavors left by the autolysis of the yeasts, as this does not usually occur.",

For the production of sparkling wines that display the character of the base wines, without the alteration and masking that occurs with autolysis, this method may prove to be ideal. It is particularly useful for aromatic varietals such as Muscat and Riesling, and fruity-style sparkling wines such as Prosecco from northeastern Italy. Recent studies have shown that autolysis can be induced by, for example, using shovels to stir up the sediment and bring it into more direct contact with the wine during the second fermentation. The quality of the base wine and the care taken during production have a great influence on the final product.

    "text": "The Asti Method is often considered a variation of the tank method, but differs in that it does not use the original dry still wine production. Using the Asti method, the sweet juice from the pressed grapes is fermented to approximately 6% vol., then cooled and filtered to stop the fermentation. At this stage, the partially fermented must is still, not foamy. Sugar and yeast are then added and the must is placed in sealed tanks to continue its fermentation. When the desired alcohol content is achieved, the wine is cooled and filtered through a membrane filter to remove live yeasts, and bottled under pressure. This results in a sparkling wine, quite low in alcohol, between 7 and 7.5% vol., but with a high residual sugar content. In the case of Asti DOCG, the grape used is Muscat, with a typical intense grape aroma and flavour. The finest wines tend to have a much longer finish and a distinctive peach and tangerine flavor. Asti is best consumed when very young, and is usually fermented only when necessary. Meanwhile, the unfermented must is stored under refrigeration. If it spends too much time in storage before being consumed, it loses its fruit appeal, and develops unpleasant vegetal flavors, reminiscent of geraniums.\n\nPg.177, photo: Ice forming on the outside of tanks used for the fermentation of Asti.\n\n",

While the British have always preferred French wine, on occasion, sometimes for political reasons, they have had to try wines from elsewhere, such as Spain and Portugal, largely due to ease of transport. For eight years, from 1678, the importation of wines from France to the United Kingdom was prohibited, and in 1703 the Treaty of Methuen was signed with Portugal, which immediately increased trade between the two countries. During that season, the red wines of Portugal were light and acidic, unable to withstand the rigors of a journey across the Bay of Biscay and were unappealing to the consumer.

The delimited region extends about 60 km. from the Spanish border downriver to the town of Régua. However, the heart of the region is centred around the town of Pinhao, about 20 km away. upriver from Régua. This is where most of the properties, or quintas, are located.

The theory behind all this is to ensure that no more wine is produced than can be sold at a profit. Many factors must be taken into account when calculating vineyard quotas. The grower can control some, but not all. In descending order of importance, these factors are:\n\nLow yields\n\nAltitude\n\nSoil composition\n\nVineyard management\n\nCultivated varietals\n\nSlope grade\n\nSun exposure\n\nSpace between vines\n\nProtection from strong winds\n\nAge of the vines\n\nAfter these factors are considered, vineyards are given scores from A to E, with three-quarters receiving scores between C and D.

    "text": "Traditionally, the extraction of colour and tannins from grapes was carried out by treading the grapes in granite enclosures or winepresses. The grapes, crushed or not, were placed inside these enclosures, and groups of workers trampled them for about 12 hours. Workers could alternate periods of treading with other activities such as dancing. The fermenting must was then introduced into open containers and the caps were regularly dipped to extract more colour. This method may still be practiced in some traditional estates, whose wines will be sold at high prices and the labour costs will be absorbed, but robotic winepresses and mechanised punching down are becoming more common. For less prestigious wines, autovinifiers can be used. Using this method, the crushed grapes are placed in tightly sealed containers and the CO2 pressure resulting from fermentation is used to force the juice through pipes so that it continually sprays onto the skins, seeds and stems. This process is much more economical. One disadvantage is that the installation of specialized containers requires a high investment. An alternative is the traditional pumping-over method, which is very common in all wine regions, although this leads to a less vigorous extraction of colour, flavours and tannins.\n\nPg. 179, photo: Terraced vineyards at Quinta do Seixo.\n\n",

They are exceptional products from a particular year, typically from the best vineyards, which are bottled when they are two years old. When young they are complex, rich and tannic. They are slow to mature and may not reach their peak until they are 20 years or older. They will leave a thick deposit and should be decanted and consumed within a few days of opening the bottle. Each winery can determine whether it wants to declare a “vintage.” There is not always a common agreement on what a harvest year is. For example, some wineries declared 1991 as one vintage, others 1992, and others both. However, there was unanimity in declaring the 2000 harvest.\n\nSingle Quinta Vintage Ports are vintage Ports, which are the product of a single estate.

It is an autonomous region within Portugal and, as such, is within the EU. The island is extremely fertile, partly due to its volcanic soils, but also because, during the 15th century, the dense forests that covered it were burned to create pastures. This has given an exceptionally high potassium content to the soil. Its geographical position made the island a very important supply port for voyages from Europe to the Americas, South Africa and the Indies. As a result, their wines became known throughout the world and were sold mainly through British companies. Also, historically wines were often sent on long voyages as part of their aging process. Today, France is the most important export market, although much of the wine sold there is used only for culinary purposes.\n\n",

Alternatively, fermentation can be stopped before all the sugar has been consumed by adding grape spirit.

The first was a decree restricting the amount of stock each company has for sale each year. This is usually about a third, which ensures that, indeed, most Sherry wines are at least 3 years old.\n\nSecondly, there was a voluntary decision by the wineries to prohibit the export of bulk sherry.

Muddy and slippery when wet, when dry they create a hard layer that inhibits evaporation. There are three subtypes of soil recognized in the area depending on the amount of limestone, which ranges from a maximum of 80% to a minimum of 30%. Under the sun the floors appear white, due to the reflection of the chalk.\n\nAlbariza soils are found mainly in the heart of the Sherry Wines region, between the Jerez Hills and the Guadalquivir River. This is where the best grapes are grown.\n\nThe second type of soil is sand (compacted sand is 70% and 10% or less limestone). The sand contains a proportion of iron oxide, which gives it a reddish brown colour, although the subsoil is often calcareous. This type of soil is now mainly planted with Muscat grapes, and much of the land that used to be vineyards is now used to grow vegetables and set up greenhouses.\n\nThe third type is mud.

The grape has a very thin skin and this can lead to grape breakage, causing rot in the period before harvest.

In either case, it is collected by hand due to its delicate constitution and susceptibility to damage. The grape pickers have to carefully place the cut bunches in plastic boxes containing 15/17 kg. of grape.\n\nPedro Ximénez (PX) is generally planted in the lower parts of vineyards with sandy or clay soils. After being picked, the grapes are usually left to dry in the sun on mats. This concentrates the sugar levels. The result is a wine often used for sweetening.

Due to the cooler climate, the flower remains active all year round, which gives the wine a special, more delicate and slightly salty character.

Some spirits can be made from a particular raw material, as is the case with grape brandy. Others, such as Vodka, can be made from a wide range of raw materials, including various grains, potatoes, and even sugar cane and grapes.\n\n",

The wine is heated by direct heat to 80ºC; traditionally coal was used but nowadays gas is used. The vapours are concentrated in the head and pass to the swan neck through a pipe that can pass through the next batch of wine to heat it, before entering the condenser. The result of this first distillation, the brouillis, has a graduation of between 26 and 30% vol. and the volume will be one third of the original wine.\n\nFor the second distillation, the brouillis from three batches are combined and distilled again to produce a 72% abv spirit. This time, the heads and tails are removed, although as this method of distilling is not very precise, they still contain ethanol, so they are added to the next batch of brouillis.

However, it is governed by the same laws as other Scotch whiskies, and must be aged for a minimum period of three years and benefits considerably from the softening effects of oak. This spirit matures quickly. Almost all production is used for blended whiskies, but single and vatted grain whiskies also exist.\n\nP. 203, photo: Dalwhinnie's 'spirits vault'; photo: By law, Scotch whisky must be aged in Scotland in oak casks for a minimum of three years.\n\n",

Most whisky, however, is sold as “blended” whisky, a mixture of different malt and grain whiskies from different distilleries. Standard blends rarely put the age on the label, although the youngest spirit must have been aged for a minimum of 3 years. The quality of the blend will owe much to the nature of the single malt whisky it contains, as it is the one that imparts the most flavour although it is a more expensive component. Deluxe blends will contain both grain and malt whisky, but it will generally be the latter that will give it more personality. Most deluxe blends will have an age on the label of 8, 12 and 17 years. Again, this means that all components are at least of the stated age. In practice, this often means that grain whiskies will be of the minimum age, while single malts will be considerably older.\n\n",

Bushmills in Northern Ireland produces single malt and blended whiskies using grain whisky from Middleton in the Republic of Ireland. Most brands of Irish whiskey are produced at the Middleton Distillery. Stills interconnected with continuous distillers, a variety of malted and unmalted grains and the choice of different casks result in a wide variety of whisky styles, which different brands benefit from for their blended whiskies. The key characteristics of Bushmills and Middleton whiskies are that the malt is produced entirely without peat, and that they use triple distillation (although, as a result of the system of interconnected distillers at Middleton, it is possible that some spirit has been distilled four, five or even more times). The result is a smooth, honeyed whisky. The Cooley distillery produces different brands of the same smooth styles. But it also uses peat at times, and one of its brands is similar in style to Islay Single Malt.\n\n",

Although only a few premium brands use stills, most use continuous distillation. Unlike Scotch, which can use caramel to adjust the color, all of Bourbon's color must come from the aging process.\n\nWithin the giant warehouses, different locations result in different aging processes. A producer may introduce a barrel rotation regime to ensure consistency between barrels. Alternatively, consistency can be achieved by blending barrels with different properties. Barrels in the centre of the warehouse tend to age more slowly as they are exposed to lower temperatures. They produce whiskies with more finesse and complexity. Barrels that have particular desirable characteristics may be bottled separately as Small Batch Bourbons. Other Small Batch Bourbons are, literally, Bourbons that have been distilled and aged in small batches.

After the long, sharp, prickly leaves have been removed from the piña (heart) of the harvested agave, it is slowly cooked to convert the starch into fermented sugars.

A wide variety of basic materials can be used, including cereals, grains, potatoes and even grapes. It would be too much to say that vodkas are completely neutral.

Although many of these herbs could be dried, it was realized that their benefits were better preserved if they were macerated in alcohol. In this way, the treatment would be available all year round.

These are generally based on specific aged spirits, such as Grand Marnier, which has a cognac base, and Drambuie, based on Scotch whisky. Many others are simply made by infusing or macerating the aromatic ingredients in the spirit and adding sugar. Ideally, if the flavor is fruity, fresh fruit will be added. As this can restrict the production period, to maintain freshness throughout the year, the producer must store the fruit in cold chambers.

Excessive heat or cold will cause the wine to deteriorate.\n\nBottles should be stored lying down, with the label facing up. This way the corks stay moist through contact with the wine.

They can be Sauvignon Blanc from Marlborough in New Zealand or Cabernet Sauvignon from Suhindol in Bulgaria.

For example, the province of La Rioja in Argentina does not\n\ncan sell its wines in the EU under that name, if not under the name of Valle de Famatina.

Many countries outside the EU have their own legal systems for defining quality (such as AVAs in the United States) and they may appear on bottles sold in the EU, although they have no legal validity. Where vintages, varietals and regions are listed, most countries legislate that the wine must be made from a minimum of 85% (75% for California) grapes from the vintages, varietals and regions listed.
