It’s named ‘Nettie’ after Miss Nettie Valear who planted an acorn on the site of the now-vineyard in memory of Abraham Lincoln. Now a majestic oak, it’s a reminder that while California feels relatively ‘New World’, wine has been made there for more than two centuries. Classic varieties like Viognier flourish there. This wine is a case in point – it’s full of character. It’s big. It’s lush. It’s fruity. Full of peach and apricot flavours, with a really rich, round texture. Excellent with Thai spiced chicken or shellfish. Characteristics: Pear, Apricot, Floral, Honey, Peach Style: Aromatic & Floral",

Once crafted, a portion of the blend is left to age on its lees, which adds a creamy texture to this impressive wine. It’s a wonderfully aromatic, bone-dry Provence rosé.

It’s made using the appassimento method, which has been a distinctly northern Italian style of winemaking for centuries. Primo’s winemaker, Alessandro Michelon, was the first outside of Veneto to adopt the method. He realised that Puglia’s sun-drenched, windswept vineyards offer an ideal climate for the process; once grapes are ripe, his team move through the vines, twisting the stem of every other bunch. This stops them from ripening further and allows them to dry in the wind, resulting in a concentrated and complex wine.

The grapes come from twenty-five-year-old vines, and each and every one is handpicked in the cool of dawn to make sure as many of the aromatics are preserved as possible. All that work pays off. It’s a deliciously crisp wine, full of citrusy zing. But thanks to Sicily’s warm climate, it also has riper, peachy flavours and fragrant, herby aromas. Delicious with freshly caught seafood. Characteristics: Peach, Citrus Fruit, Floral Style: Smooth & Light",

    "description": "Think ‘appassimento’, you'll most likely think Amarone – or other really plush reds. It’s a method of making wine with a portion of dried grapes, concentrating all the flavours and giving it a real richness of texture. But this wine is a little different. For a start, it’s white – and every single part of its production is designed to make it richer and more intensely flavoured. The grapes are left to dry in special racks, concentrating the sugars and aromas. After it’s pressed the wine is left on its skins to make the texture rounded and the flavours bolder. Finally, a portion is aged in oak for added creaminess. No wonder it’s a beast of a wine. Bold. Fruity. Plush. There’s a lovely balance of fresh citrus flavours and apricoty, peachy richness. Delicious with roast chicken. Characteristics: Tropical Fruit, Apricot, Peach Style: Aromatic & Floral",

Established in 1976, the family-owned winery has gained global success thanks to their commitment to making wines of only the highest quality. Originating from France, the Viognier grape has flourished in Chile’s Rapel Valley, and the family know exactly how to draw out its signature ripe and aromatic flavours. To add a little richness, this Reserva spends just two months in oak which, in turn, retains maximum freshness. It’s bright and zingy with notes of pear, peach and apricot, plus a minerality which adds to its elegance. Viognier’s full, fruity flavour complements spice perfectly. So pair this with your favourite spicy Asian dish. Characteristics: Peach, Apricot, Floral Style: Ripe & Rounded",

It’s right in the heel of Italy’s boot – and you’d be forgiven for thinking the sun-baked vines could never produce a wine as silky and soft as this. But it’s precisely that heat that Primitivo loves. The grapes are left on the vines until they’re almost overripe – giving the flavours incredible concentration. Intense. Velvety. Ripe. It’s full of plummy, red-fruit flavour with moreish spice. Ageing in oak for a year gives it an extra dimension of flavour, smoothing the plush tannins.

But leave it to Louis Latour, Burgundy superstars, to find a way to make to a Pinot Noir which is both delicious and every-day affordable. They looked to Var, in Southern France. An unusual choice, perhaps, for this cool-climate-loving grape, but at 500 meters above sea level you’re guaranteed the perfect conditions. It’s made on the site of an abandoned monastery at the same altitude as the Grand Cru red Burgundies which made Latour’s name. Cherry. Raspberry. Blackcurrants.

For four generations, the Lucas family have dedicated their lives to crafting expressive wines that reflect their unique terroir and local wine making traditions. However, the last century presented significant obstacles. In 1949, under the Soviet Union regime, the Lucas’ vineyards were nationalised and the whole of their family were deported to a Siberian labour camp. After several years, part of the family managed to return to the winery. And today, almost sixty years on, the Carpe Diem estate is thriving.

His minimal intervention approach includes carefully hand-picked harvests and zero chemical use in the vineyards. He ages this Viré-Clessé on its lees in small oak barrels for up to 15 months. The result is a richly textured Chardonnay with crisp notes of citrus, stone fruits and blossom, balanced by a delicate minerality. The 2020 vintage scooped an IWC award in 2022.

The remaining 25% is kept in stainless steel tanks, altogether resulting in a rich wine balanced by freshness.

It’s a textbook Mendoza Malbec, packed with those classic black berry and red-fruit flavours. Think blackberries, cherries and a touch of the floral, violet aromas which mark it out as a high-quality wine. We think our buyers have hit it out of the park – and we’re sure that you’ll love it just as much as we do.

It’s made using dried grapes. That’s standard practice for sweet wines. as it reduces the water volume in the grapes, upping the percentage of sugar.

In an innovative step, he acquired Domaine de la La Métairie d'Alon in 2015 – a high-altitude vineyard, just a stone’s throw from Limoux. He farms organically, and with vast experience of crafting fine Burgundy wines, brings the same standards of winemaking to new territory. The handpicked grapes for Le Village are gently pressed, with just under half the wine spending 6 months in oak barrels to add complexity.

The grapes ripen slowly, developing really concentrated, berry-fruit flavours which are a trademark of the Marlborough style. Added to which, Brent Marris is the master of Marlborough – he knows how to get the very best out of his grapes in these famous valleys. It’s a real corker of the wine. Ripe. Juicy. Fruity. It’s full of raspberry, strawberry and red plum flavours, with a nicely savoury quality and silky texture. Perfect with slow-cooked beef ragu.\n\nIn 2022, this wine won an IWC award for the 2020 vintage.

Madame Clicquot's innovative thinking saw her invent winemaking techniques that are still used in Champagne today. So it's no wonder her influence earned her the title of 'La Grande Dame de la Champagne'. This Pinot Noir-dominant cuvée was created in 1972 to honour the 'Great Lady' – and to also celebrate the bicentenary of the house. Madame Clicquot believed that Pinot Noir had the broadest range of expression and potential to create the best Champagnes. Veuve's current cellar master, Didier Mariotti, wholeheartedly agrees and the grape now accounts for up to 90 percent of the blend. He sums up this prestigious wine as  ‘structured and textured’. With such exquisite flavour and complexity, we’re certain you’ll find popping its cork a memorable event. Expect fine bubbles that are delicately creamy, with lively notes of ripe lemon, rye bread and a hint of smokiness. Its incredibly fresh, making every sip mouthwatering. Italian artist and ceramicist Paola Paronetto is behind the label and packaging design of the 2015 vintage. Her love of colour is reflected in the vast array of eye-catching cases.

It means the Albariños from here are extra crisp and green-fruity. They age this on the lees which gives the wine even more complexity and a lovely viscous texture which works incredibly with all those zingy, citrussy flavours. It’s a really special, unusual Albariño which is perfect if you love both crisp whites and richer styles of wine. But there’s a catch. Only 1,100 cases of this wine were made – so be quick.

In England it’s referred to as Pinot Gris, just like in France, where the grape originates from. It’s not a common planting here, and you’ll find few estates make it better than Bolney – one of the oldest wineries in the country. 2022 marks 50 years of winemaking for founders Janet and Rodney Pratt, and daughter Sam, who has followed in their pioneering footsteps. This Pinot Gris was the first English still wine to be served at Wimbledon, and it doesn’t get more British than that. Ripe. Rounded. Silky.

He was the first producer to be organically certified by Demeter back in 1984 – and he’s been leading the charge for pesticide-free viticulture ever since. Utilising his extensive network of growers, Didier crafts this wine from two idyllic premier cru plots. They’re situated high on the hillsides of Beaune where perfect sun exposure and limestone and clay soils result in deliciously ripe grapes with complex flavours. The 2018 harvest produced Pinot Noir with extra richness and silky tannins – and this is a case in point. Expect ripe and juicy red-fruit flavours with earthy notes and hints of baking spice. Its punchy flavours make it a great match for game birds.",

It means their organic Sancerre wines are of incredible quality – and incredibly well made. Think tart green apple. The pear and lemon notes are trademark Fouassier, and it’s so crisp you’ll find it slipping down all too easily. Full, fruity – it’s incredibly intense so the flavours really last. That fruitiness combined with Thai-syle spice is a marriage made in heaven. Characteristics: Green Apple, Citrus Fruit, Cream, Grass Style: Fresh & Elegant",

Passed down from fathers to sons, their vineyards have been extensively developed over the years. Fast forward to today, they have 50 plots spread across some of the best terroirs in the region. With the aim of producing wines that showcase the best of the region, their pursuit of quality has led to considerable winery renovations. They’ve even built their facilities into the hillsides, where grapes are pumped by gravity. And the reduction of human interaction results in a truly pure expression of the wines. This has classic Loire Sauvignon flavours of green apple, lively citrus and ripe stone fruits, with herby hints and a fresh, mineral finish. Its crisp acidity makes it a delicious apéritif or an ideal pairing for seafood and smoked fish.",

A cooler coastal influence results in a more restrained style than the bold-and-jammy Shiraz of Barossa and Mclaren Vale. In a nod towards the traditional Syrah blends of the Rhône Valley's Côte-Rôtie, winemaker Eloise Jarvis blends her red Shiraz grapes with white Viognier to dial up the complexity. Viognier is rich and aromatic, so adding it to a blend brings freshness, softens tannins, and enhances any fruity and floral notes. Côte-Rôtie wines usually come with lofty prices, but this Cape Mentelle favourite means you can enjoy the style at a fraction of the cost. Expect a complex and structured wine with layers of violets, dark forest fruits and wild cherries. Intense savoury notes of tobacco, leather and spice mean this wine matches well with simple grilled meats or rich vegetable-laden stews.

To do this, they brought together 62 small growers from some of Hungary's finest winemaking areas. Renowned for its incredible range of sweet wines, Royal Tokaji has since become one of the most important names in the wine world. This wine's sweetness is achieved by allowing the grapes extended ripening time on the vine, increasing their sugar content. Expect rich notes of ripe peach, exotic fruits and blossom. It has the perfect balance of honeyed sweetness and fresh acidity, making a great pairing for fruit tarts, baklava, or ripe blue cheese. Characteristics: Rose, Honeysuckle, Lychee",

Produced from decades-old vines, this complex Merlot is aged for 18 months in oak before it’s released. Its intense flavour and structure means it can age for up to another decade or more – so it’s no surprise leading critic Tim Atkin awarded it 91 points. Expect opulent notes of ripe bramble fruits, dark chocolate and spice. Its silky tannins and rich flavours make it a great match for red meats.",

    "description": "Despite the label, you can consider this bottle to be a Chianti Rufina Reserva DOCG – Chianti’s most northerly subzone – and the area renowned for making the region’s most long lived wines. Sat in the foothills of the Apennine mountains, vines here benefit from warm sunny days followed by cool nights. The huge changes in temperature results in wines with intense aromas and plenty of fresh acidity – and it’s this acidity that gives them their lengthy ageing potential. Due to a change in production rules in the 1980s, the prestigious Grato family can’t label this bottling a Chianti Rufina. They keep back some of their best cuvées, ageing them for longer than the DOCG panel allows. It means they become what's known as a declassified wine, but don’t let that fool you into thinking this is anything less than a first-rate Tuscan red. Predominantly Sangiovese, the blend spent 30 months in oak barrels, followed by further ageing in tank and bottle before release. Discover intense notes of ripe black cherry and forest floor, with hints of cinnamon spice and leather. It has a silky and savoury character with mellowed tannins, making it a delicious choice for roasted game. Characteristics: Cinnamon, Cooked Fruit, Leather, Spice Style: Savoury & Full Bodied",

    "description": "Wine has been produced at Domaine Saint Ferréol since 1146. In 1998, the property was bought by Jorje and Ania Maslakiewicz, who have a much-deserved reputation for making some of the very best Viognier in the Languedoc. Their wines are reminiscent of Condrieu, the finest and most expensive expression of Viognier, but come without the usual price tag. This is named 'Grande Réserve' for good reason – once it's aged in oak for ten months, it's not released until it's spent a further year in the bottle. As a result, it's truly indulgent. Discover rich and warming notes of peach, apricot, butterscotch and vanilla. Great with poultry, game, fish, mature cheeses and spicy Asian foods.
