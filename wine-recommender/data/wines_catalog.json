Monterey is known for its big Chardonnays, but Carneros is far cooler, so flavours are more understated. And you'll taste the benefits in this bold and buttery wine.

White Burgundy is a go-to for Chardonnay drinkers, and the Mâconnais in particular offers great value. Unlike the northern Côtes, the southern part of Burgundy doesn’t have a formalised vineyard hierarchy system. So the wines tend to be a bit more wallet-friendly. Not to mention, Lugny is one of the best regarded villages in the Mâcon, and Latour one of the most famous houses. Honeyed. Peachy. Crisp. A dream with salty finger foods or a classic Sunday roast chicken. It’s proof that sometimes it pays to stick with the old favourites.

It’s exactly the sort of position that pernickety Pinot thrives in. This deliciously silky wine proves our point. It’s all about red fruit. Cherries. Raspberries. Cranberries.

Fearful of an assassination attempt, he asked that it be produced in a clear bottle with no indent, called a ‘punt’, in the bottom. And an icon was born. It’s made from seven Grand Crus and only in the best years, when low-yielding Pinot Noir and Chardonnay vines produce perfectly ripe grapes.

The first time Pierre Taittinger visited Champagne was as an injured officer during WWI. He promised himself that he would return and buy an estate for his family. In 1932 he did just that. The sale included some of the original vineyards which had been planted by Benedictine monks in the 1730s. And the rest is history. This is a classic Champagne, full of honeysuckle, brioche and pear flavours. Taittinger was Bond’s Champagne of choice in the original novels, so try it with something equally sophisticated. We suggest cheese gougères, fresh from the oven. Style: Crisp & Fruity",

Founded in the 1990s, their mission was to break the mould and showcase the diversity of this iconic grape. They’ve more than succeeded – and they’re now regarded as Shiraz experts. ‘Angels' Share’ was one of their very first wines. Its name refers to the small amount of wine that evaporates from oak barrels during maturation, which mediaeval winemakers believed angels took as they watched over their wines. It’s brilliantly bold and flavoursome – a full-on Australian Shiraz, with a silky texture and smooth tannins. Flavours of blueberry, dried herbs and a hint of game are ideal for barbecued meats.

Each grape is selected from vines that are at least 50 years old. Mature vines make the tastiest grapes. So the wine is incredibly rich and concentrated.

And each blend carries its own number – in reference to the number of harvests that have taken place since Maison Lanson was founded in 1760. This, the 257th blend, predominantly uses wine from the 2017 vintage, which produced Chardonnay with marked freshness, intensely fruity Pinot Noir, and notably supple Pinot Meunier.

    "description": "Light-bodied white wine from Pinot Grigio in Veneto. Dry with high acidity. Characteristics: fresh, crisp, floral, refreshing. Flavor notes: lime, lemon. Pinot Grigio’s heartland is in Veneto, northeast Italy. It’s where you’ll find Breganze DOC, a tiny region in the Alpine foothills which is known for prioritising quality above all else. In fact, it’s so small that the region’s growers have formed a single cooperative – Beato Bartolomeo Breganze. If Pinot Grigio is a must for your wine rack, then this one is a first-rate choice. Fresh and light, with crisp citrus flavours and floral aromas, this is Pinot Grigio at its most refreshing. Fantastic as an apéritif, but also with green salads and light fish dishes.

Quinta da Calçada are one of the oldest producers in Vinho Verde’s Amarante region. The Lago Cerqueira family built their cellars here in 1917 – and over a century later, their wines have gone from strength to strength. This is an elegant expression of Alvarinho—known in Spain as Albariño— thanks to the subregion’s high elevation. Due to the vineyard’s lofty altitudes, grapes benefit from the warm, sunny days and cooler nighttime temperatures. The result? Ripe, juicy flavour balanced by a refreshing acidity. Expect floral hints and notes of tropical fruit and citrus. The refreshing acidity and minerality makes it a great part for fried fish dishes like calamari or fresh sushi and sashimi.

In 2001 he decided to take his considerable expertise to the Languedoc and, together with his wife Christine, bought the historic Château d'Anglès. The estate lies in La Clape, an appellation famed for the quality of its reds. And that quality is certainly reflected in this, the château’s grand vin. It’s an expressive, full-bodied blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre, which spends at least 10 months maturing in oak to give it extra complexity and a smooth, decadent texture. Expect powerful flavours of ripe red and black fruits, liquorice and tobacco, plus a long, fresh finish that pairs perfectly with juicy meats. Try it with steak or cellar it for up to 20 years.

Flavor notes: cherry, raspberry, redcurrant, vanilla, black fruit, black plum. In the heel of Italy's boot, you’ll find Puglia – the home of Primitivo. But this particular bottling is anything but ordinary for the region. It’s made using the appassimento method, which has been a distinctly northern Italian style of winemaking for centuries. Primo’s winemaker, Alessandro Michelon, was the first outside of Veneto to adopt the method. He realised that Puglia’s sun-drenched, windswept vineyards offer an ideal climate for the process; once grapes are ripe, his team move through the vines, twisting the stem of every other bunch. This stops them from ripening further and allows them to dry in the wind, resulting in a concentrated and complex wine. Just like a Valpolicella, it’s big, plush and velvety, with ripe flavours of cherry, raspberry and redcurrant. A rich, meaty stew makes the perfect partner to its bold, fruity character.

Flavor notes: blackberry, plum, mocha, spice, smoke. The Capaia estate lies in the village of Philadelphia, part of the Tygerberg district, just a short distance north of Cape Town. Here, vineyards bask in a suntrap under the shelter of the Koeberg hills. And cool breezes from the nearby Atlantic Ocean allow the grapes to ripen slowly, developing deliciously concentrated flavours. Winemaker Stephan von Neipperg has been involved with the winery since 2005. As the owner of two Grand Cru Classé Saint-Émilion estates, he brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise in Bordeaux-style blending – and it shows in this – Capaia’s flagship red. It’s made with just as much precision as the best Bordeaux châteaux. Grapes from each vineyard are fermented separately in oak barrels before being blended. For extra complexity, the wine spends 18 months maturing in French oak before bottling. If you can resist opening it, it will continue to develop for up to 10 years. You'll find it robust yet balanced, with flavours of blackberry, plum and mocha. Its firm tannins and a hint of smoke make it an excellent match for hearty game dishes.

Pinot Grigio only came to Sicily in the past couple of decades. It’s usually thought of as a northern Italian grape – but it’s taken to its new island home like a duck to water. This organic Pinot Grigio was lovingly made by Frederico ‘Fede’ Stella – a gentle giant who knows how to coax the very best from his grapes. The grapes come from twenty-five-year-old vines, and each and every one is handpicked in the cool of dawn to make sure as many of the aromatics are preserved as possible. All that work pays off. It’s a deliciously crisp wine, full of citrusy zing. But thanks to Sicily’s warm climate, it also has riper, peachy flavours and fragrant, herby aromas. Delicious with freshly caught seafood.

Flavor notes: red fruits, herby notes, red apple, strawberry. Gérard Bertrand was once a famous rugby player. He’s now one of Southern France’s most acclaimed winemakers. His wines regularly scoop top marks from the critics, and this rosé is no different. Domaine de Villemajou sits at the heart of Corbières-Boutenac, and is considered one of its top estates. It’s where Gérard first discovered his passion for wine – his father owned the domaine in the ‘70s, and Gérard had been helping out with harvests since the age of ten. His drive for excellence shines through in this creamy and floral rosé made from the same grapes grown as the Majestic customer favourite Domaine de Villemajou Rouge. Expect aromas and flavours of red fruits and herby notes and a rich texture from a period of barrel ageing. Its fuller body will pair with more robust foods than the rosés of provence, so try this with spicy dishes or fruity cheeses. Characteristics: Cream, Red Apple, Strawberry Style: Ripe & Fruity",

    "description": "Medium-bodied red wine from Nerello Mascalese in Sicily. Dry with high acidity and low tannins. Characteristics: intense, fresh, savory. Flavor notes: raspberry, violet, jammy cherry, pomegranate. Mount Etna is an iconic feature of the Sicilian landscape. It’s one of the world’s most active volcanoes and has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2013. Its highly fertile soils make it a prime spot for agriculture – and it’s here that Torre Mora grow their grapes. They make this wine from two local varieties, Nerello Mascalese and Nerello Cappuccio. Its name, ‘Cauru’, means ‘hot’ in Sicilian – a reference to the heat and energy contained in the volcanic soils. This heat makes for intense, ripe flavours, but the wine is also remarkably fresh thanks to the region’s drastically cooler nighttime temperatures, which help retain the grapes’ natural acidity. Discover vibrant notes of raspberry and violet, with jammy cherry flavours and fine, silky tannins. You can also expect a distinct savoury character that makes this an ideal accompaniment to richer poultry, mushroom-based dishes and mature cheeses. Characteristics: Citrus Fruit, Date, Raspberry, Red Cherry, Violet, Pomegranate Style: Smooth & Mellow",

The winery has become synonymous with distinctive, high-quality wines made with passion. The grapes for this rosé come from two terroirs – the Hérault plain which lends richness and roundness, and the Aude area which gives character and freshness. The result is a balanced wine full of refreshing, fruity flavour. It has charming aromas of wild strawberry and raspberry, enhanced by refreshing mineral notes.

The Rothschild wine legacy began in 1868 when James de Rothschild purchased Bordeaux’s Château Lafite – an estate which was already synonymous with the finest wines of the region. Over a century later, his grandson, Baron Edmond, set out to create South African wines with the same level of renown. With the help of local businessman Dr Anton Rupert, he began producing blends in Franschhoek using the same traditional grape varieties found in Bordeaux. And it wasn’t long before the world took notice. Today, the estate is managed by the next generation of both families – and their wines continue to attract international acclaim. This is made predominantly from Merlot and is matured for over a year in French oak. Discover juicy flavours of raspberry, cherry and plum, with notes of forest floor and toasty oak spice.

They're the hobbies of Michel Parisot - how he spends his downtime from making sublime Champagnes. It's a fitting portrait of a winemaker whose approach to traditional fizz is decidedly unconventional. Michel is all about maximum flavour. Pinot Noir grapes are picked late in the harvest for as much aromatic flavour as possible. Michel then uses only the first press of the grapes, guaranteeing freshness. The wine is then aged for a minimum of four years – far longer than the required 30 months. The result is a rosé Champagne which punches well above its price point.  Expect moreish flavours of redcurrant and raspberry. Although it's dry in style, the creamy texture is perfect with fruity puddings.\n\nIn 2022, this wine won an IWC award Characteristics: Red Cherry, Blossom, Raspberry Style: Crisp & Fruity",

The vineyard that this wine comes from is also steeped in history. Côtes des Embouffants was singled out by Abbot Poupart in his 1777 history of Sancerre, saying that that 'the Bouffants hillside is one of the best I know in our Sancerre area’. Nearly 250 years later, his assessment still holds true. The chalky soils are perfect for vibrant, crisp Sauvignon, and the flavours really leap out of the glass. It’s intensely refreshing with citrus and lime acidity, and a hard-to-put-your-finger-on complexity from six months of lees ageing. Ideal with a classic goat’s cheese tart.

It’s a method of making wine with a portion of dried grapes, concentrating all the flavours and giving it a real richness of texture. But this wine is a little different. For a start, it’s white – and every single part of its production is designed to make it richer and more intensely flavoured. The grapes are left to dry in special racks, concentrating the sugars and aromas. After it’s pressed the wine is left on its skins to make the texture rounded and the flavours bolder. Finally, a portion is aged in oak for added creaminess. No wonder it’s a beast of a wine. Bold. Fruity. Plush. There’s a lovely balance of fresh citrus flavours and apricoty, peachy richness.

    "description": "Light-bodied white wine from Sauvignon Blanc in Marlborough. Dry with high acidity. Characteristics: vibrant, fresh, tropical. Flavor notes: guava, gooseberry, blackcurrant leaf, green apple, lemon, stone fruit. Brent Marris is winemaking royalty. And it turns out, he may be descended from actual royalty too. His ancestor, William de Marisco was rumoured to be the illegitimate son of Henry I – not that that guaranteed the family good relations with royalty. The de Mariscos spent much of the 12th and 13th centuries living a life of piracy on the Isle of Lundy. Brent created the King Series to celebrate his family’s history, and their tempestuous relationship with the monarchy. This is a classic Waihopai Sauvignon Blanc – an important Marlborough sub-region where the wines are particularly vibrant. Think guava, gooseberry and a hint of blackcurrant leaf which sets this apart from the standard. Of course, it’s also mouth-wateringly fresh – a dream with barbecued fish with mango salsa. Characteristics: Tropical Fruit, Grass, Green Apple, Lemon, Stone Fruit Style: Crisp & Zesty",

Dessert wines have been made this way in Sicily for centuries, but the dry Nero Oro is something entirely unique – and you’ll only find it at Majestic.

So, it was a no-brainer addition to our Definition range. We wanted something exciting to do justice to New Zealand’s pioneering spirit. So, we headed to Marlborough. The region’s history with Pinot is younger, but if there was anyone who could help us get the blend just right it was Marlborough and Pinot experts, Saint Clair. With them we selected grapes from top parcels in the Southern Valleys – the best site for Pinot in the region. The results speak for themselves. It’s deliciously savoury with classic Marlborough dark fruit. Think black cherry and raspberry. It’s perfumed but fresh, with fine tannins and a lovely silky texture. Ideal with duck.

This Pinot Noir is crafted by winemakers Duncan Savage and Thys Louw, from nearby family estate Diemersdal. We’re certain it’s a soon-to-be-uncovered gem. It's unusual to find such high quality at such an affordable price, but this wine truly delivers. You'll find soft red cherry, plum and summer fruit notes, plus a touch of baking spice.

Flavor notes: strawberry, violets, red berries, raspberry, red cherry. 18-year-old Georges Duboeuf knew his family’s wines had the potential to become some of the most celebrated Beaujolais in France. In 1964, he set off on his bicycle with a selection of bottles strapped to his back. He pedalled around some of the most celebrated French restaurateurs of the day and they all loved the food-friendly wines. Georges’ success inspired him to expand the family business and build relationships with some of the best growers in Beaujolais. Fleurie is one of best appellations in the region – known for producing floral, delicate wines. Think violets and red berries, with a really silky texture. As for food – it’s brilliant with charcuterie and terrines. Characteristics: Strawberry, Floral, Raspberry, Red Cherry Style: Soft & Fruity",

It’s right in the heel of Italy’s boot – and you’d be forgiven for thinking the sun-baked vines could never produce a wine as silky and soft as this. But it’s precisely that heat that Primitivo loves. The grapes are left on the vines until they’re almost overripe – giving the flavours incredible concentration. Intense. Velvety. Ripe. It’s full of plummy, red-fruit flavour with moreish spice. Ageing in oak for a year gives it an extra dimension of flavour, smoothing the plush tannins.

We challenged the producer to go into the vineyards and root out the very best parcels of grapes. What they discovered were grapes of such incredible quality they warranted extra special care and attention. They handpicked and carefully sorted the grapes, then slowly aged the wine in oak barrels.

This wine is actually made for us by one of the most prestigious winemaking families in Chile, the Arestis. They know how to get the very best peachy, citrussy flavours out of their grapes, while still keeping prices wallet-friendly. The Central Valley, where this wine is from, is cool but has loads of sunshine – so this is more like a ripe white Bordeaux than a full, tropically fruity Kiwi Sauvignon. The fact is, Chilean wines are just incredible value – a wine of this quality from another country could cost far more. In our book, that makes it the ideal party wine. It’s got a real citrussy zing and great tropical flavours. It’s incredibly refreshing, so your guests will be happy to drink it alone, or with finger foods.

Originally from Latvia, Russian Jack was one of these gentlemen of the road.  He'd appear on farms at harvest time to pick fruit, well into his old age. As a result, he became a bit of a legend. There's even a statue in his memory. And this wine lives up to his name. It's made with grapes from certified sustainable vineyards, and there’s no compromise on quality. Every vintage has only one bottling, with the wine left on its spent yeast cells (or ‘lees’) to concentrate the flavours and add texture. This is a seriously aromatic Sauvignon, with notes of passionfruit, elderflower and gooseberry. Try it with spicy grilled fish.

He’s taken Majestic’s number one best-selling wine, and made it even better. The Guv’nor rewrote the rule book on wine, taking away vintages, classifications and restrictions. The VIP just wrote a new chapter. The Guv’nor VIP launches exclusively in time for Summer 2023. Drink on warm summer evenings, paired with barbecues or around campfires.

In fact, it’s the only grape that’s grown in the whole region – so Montagny-based Cave de Buxy really know their Chardonnay inside-out. Montagny’s limestone soils mean the wines are fresh, with a fuller body than other Chalonnaise wines. The fruit flavours are really pronounced – a factor amped up by the fact that it’s ‘Vielles Vignes’. It’s made using grapes from thirty-year-old vines. Because they’re old, they only yield small amounts of grapes – so all the flavour is exceptionally concentrated. Think ripe apple, citrus and white blossom. The ripeness is balanced by serious crispness, and it’s left unoaked so the fruit flavours can really shine through. Perfect with chicken.

Flavor notes: plummy, cherry, violet, black fruit, red fruit. Argentine Malbec is so popular, few people realise the grape is actually native to France. Mendoza, Argentina’s Malbec-heartland, is the place to look for the style of lush, fruity Malbec which put Argentina on the map. So, when we wanted to add a Malbec to our Definition range, Mendoza was the only place to look. Specifically, the Uco Valley – a sub-region where high-altitude vineyards make the very best Malbec. Working with a top producer, we sourced parcels of super-ripe fruit. The result? This plush, silky red which is all about the plummy, cherry fruit flavours. We only used a very small amount of oak to add a bit of structure, but not overpower the vibrant fruitiness. It’s a really classic style – so it’s perfect with a good steak or other barbecued meats.\n\nIn 2022, this wine won an IWC award for the 2020 vintage.

But despite their long history, Jackson Estate have always preferred to keep production low key. They’re all about sustainably made wines, made with minimal winemaking intervention. This is released six months later than other Kiwi Sauvignons. That’s because it spends extra time ageing on the lees – giving a richness and roundness to the texture. This practice complements the restrained flavours, making for a more French, old-school style Sauvignon rather than the typical Marlborough tropical fruit-bomb. Think gooseberry and zingy rhubarb flavours that are perfect with goat's cheese. Characteristics: Tropical Fruit, Grass, Green Apple, Lemon, Stone Fruit Style: Crisp & Zesty",

It’s made by Boekenhoutskloof, named South Africa’s Winery of the Year 2020. Their winemaker, Marc Kent, is secretive about exactly how this wine is made. He tweaks the blend with every vintage, so no two Chocolate Blocks are quite the same. But it’s always a blend of rich and ripe varieties: Syrah, Grenache, Cinsault, Cabernet Sauvignon – with a touch of Viognier for added perfume. It’s seriously plush and full of plum, blackberry, blueberry and cherry flavours. Smooth, supple, with fine tannins – it’s made to go with food. Fantastic with aromatic lamb tagine. Characteristics: Vanilla, Black Cherry, Black Plum, Chocolate, Coffee, Tobacco Style: Rich & Juicy",

They work sustainably and organically over 35 acres, employing modern technology where appropriate. The estate is in the province of Ancona, on the border of two valleys, Valmisa and Vallesina. Structure and elegance meet citrus and peach notes – and a light yeasty kick. The team get it just right by harvesting late, in the second half of October, when grape clusters are fully ripe.

If the soil and the sun are the main characters in the story of Albariño, then the sea is the supporting act. The wild Atlantic coastline forces growers up to high altitudes. Here, the sea tempers the climate, so it’s more cool and damp than neighbouring regions. This Albariño is Rías Baixas in a bottle. The grapes are grown in terrifyingly steep amphitheatres overlooking the waves – you can taste the salt in the air in your glass.  Peachy. Citrusy. Fresh. It’s the perfect seaside wine, so it’s no surprise that it’s made for seafood – for octopus, for piles of clams and hard-won goose barnacles, a Galician speciality.

    "description": "Medium-bodied white wine from Chenin Blanc in Stellenbosch. Off-dry with high acidity. Characteristics: aromatic, floral, rich, honeyed, hearty. Flavor notes: mandarins, nectarines, stone fruit, citrus fruit. Chenin is a bit of a South African speciality – and nobody does it better than DeMorgenzon. So, it was natural that we’d source grapes for our Definition Chenin from them. Chenin is a lot like Chardonnay: it really picks up the character of its terroir. Made at high altitude, it’s like mountain air – fresh and pure. These vineyards are the first place the sun hits on the old road between Stellenbosch and Cape Town. All that sun ripens the grapes to absolute perfection, making the wine incredibly aromatic. Think mandarins and nectarines – a fruit salad of a wine, with aging on the lees giving it a lovely rich, honeyed texture. Heady and delicious. Try it with scallops or onion tart. The sweetness really complements this Chenin’s texture.\n\nIn 2022, this wine won an IWC award for the 2021 vintage. Characteristics: Stone Fruit, Citrus Fruit, Floral, Honey Style: Aromatic & Floral",

Flavor notes: blueberry, plum, cassis, black plum, blackberry, blackcurrant, chocolate, earth, leather, smoke, tobacco. Carménère may be Chile’s flagship red grape. But did you know that its history stretches back to Bordeaux? When the tiny phylloxera bugs ravaged Europe in the nineteenth century, Bordeaux’s Carménère vines were a casualty. It had been a key component of some of the greatest claret at the time – but the vine was only saved by cuttings which had been taken to Chile.  So it’s no wonder that Santa Rita use Carménère to make this fantastically structured Gran Reserva, which is styled like a classic Bordeaux. It’s a plush, velvety-smooth wine, packed with intense flavours of blueberry, plum and cassis. The firm tannins make it ideal with red meat.

Waimea is on the edge of the Tasman Sea – a place regularly credited with being New Zealand’s sunniest spot. It’s the perfect place to grow Pinot Gris. Sheltered. Coastal. Sunny. The winemaker use specially selected yeasts which draw out the aromatics of the grape. They play it up by ageing the wine on its lees – spent yeast particles – to give more texture and flavour. Think lemon curd, pear drops, lavender and white peaches. It’s got a lovely lush, creamy, silky texture with hints of exotic spice. You’ll find it hard not to reach for a second glass.

Flavor notes: plum, vanilla, baking spices, dark raspberry, chocolate, cola. Kalimna Bin 28 was first produced in 1959 and is Penfolds’ earliest Bin-collection wine. It’s named after Barossa Valley’s famous Kalimna vineyard, which was bought by Penfolds in 1945. The first releases were made entirely from this plot. Today, Bin 28 is made from multi-region vineyards, ensuring its ripe, robust character is balanced by freshness. It’s a showcase of warm-climate Australian Shiraz. So if you’re looking for just one ‘big Aussie red’ to add to your wine collection, make it this. It’s intense and full of ripe fleshy-fruit flavour. Aromas of plum, vanilla and baking spices lead to flavours of dark raspberry, chocolate and cola. Partner with seared steak.

The Trouillet family have been working the land around Pouilly for generations, and their skills have made them a Majestic favourite. Current winemaker, William Trouillet, is committed to environmentally friendly practices around the estate, crafting complex wines from his 40 to 50 year old vines. This opulent Premier Cru is full and rounded, with aromatic notes of citrus, orchard fruits and fresh blossom. A streak of minerality keeps it refreshing, and makes it a perfect pairing for shellfish. Characteristics: Almond, Citrus Fruit, Floral, Lemon Style: Ripe & Rounded",

Flavor notes: fresh citrus, white peach, pineapple, flowers, apricot, lemon. Ruinart began in 1729 and was the first established house in Champagne. But that doesn’t mean its team has stopped innovating. Its new ‘second skin’, an alternative to a gift box, is an eco-friendly innovation that reduces the bottle’s packaging carbon footprint by 60%. The paper case, moulded to the shape of the bottle, is entirely recyclable and designed to mimic the region's historic crayères cellars. As for what’s inside the bottle? The same top-quality Blanc des Blanc Champagne that Ruinart is famous for. It's made purely from Chardonnay and has aromas of fresh citrus, white peach, pineapple and flowers. Enjoy it with seafood. Think sea bass tartare or seared sole. Characteristics: Apricot, Lemon, Pastry Style: Rich & Toasty",

In 1962 George Fistonich – now Sir George – told his father he was quitting carpentry to try his hand at making wine. His gamble more than paid off. His estate is now not just a household name, but New Zealand’s most-awarded winery. Sauvignon Blanc lovers will know that New Zealand is the place to go for wines with mouth-watering freshness. But the true potential of new grape varieties grown here are just being discovered. Albariño is fairly new to Villa Maria’s repertoire, but it thrives in Gisborne’s sunshine. More importantly, the region’s cool nights mean that the grapes retain their acidity, giving it delicious crisp and refreshing flavours. It has fresh, zingy flavours of lime, peach, apricot and honeysuckle that are ideal with seafood served with a squeeze of lemon. Characteristics: Wet Stones, Green Fruit, Lemon Style: Crisp & Zesty",

An unusual choice, perhaps, for this cool-climate-loving grape, but at 500 meters above sea level you’re guaranteed the perfect conditions. It’s made on the site of an abandoned monastery at the same altitude as the Grand Cru red Burgundies which made Latour’s name. Cherry. Raspberry. Blackcurrants. It’s fruity – but with a savoury edge which is pure Pinot. The main problem with inexpensive Pinot Noirs tends to be that they’re too light – but this is silky and fresh.

Lower yields mean more concentrated flavours – and once you add a minimum of 12 months of oak ageing, you’re in for a flavourful, complex wine that’s a steal for the quality. We’re proud to have the UK exclusive on this example. Its distinctive label is inspired by the fortified turrets – or ‘tourelles’ – that were built to defend Bordeaux from sea-faring invaders.

    "description": "Light-bodied white wine from Feteasca Alba in Moldova. Dry with high acidity. Characteristics: expressive, crisp, fresh. Flavor notes: jasmine, white peach, newly cut grass. No country better demonstrates the hidden treasures of Eastern Europe than Moldova. Many drinkers might regard it as a relatively new winemaking country; however, wines have been produced here for over five thousand years. Soviet times saw a drop off in quality and reputation, but producers such as Carpe Diem continue to set new trends for the industry. For four generations, the Lucas family have dedicated their lives to crafting expressive wines that reflect their unique terroir and local wine making traditions. However, the last century presented significant obstacles. In 1949, under the Soviet Union regime, the Lucas’ vineyards were nationalised and the whole of their family were deported to a Siberian labour camp. After several years, part of the family managed to return to the winery. And today, almost sixty years on, the Carpe Diem estate is thriving. While the Soviet threat has returned – with the winery pausing operations to aid their Ukrainian neighbours – their wines continue to go from strength to strength. Crafted from an indigenous variety, Feteasca Alba, this dry white has crisp notes of jasmine, white peach and newly cut grass. It’s light and fresh – perfect for serving as an apéritif or with soft cheeses. Characteristics: Blossom, Citrus Fruit, Grass, Green Apple",

But this, an appassimento Grillo, is something entirely new. Grillo is a wonderfully aromatic and distinctly Italian white grape. It’s the perfect base for this style of winemaking.

Spain’s wine laws are notoriously strict and convoluted. The Guv'nor breaks them all. We commissioned the winemakers to make the best wine they could – no rules, no restrictions, no red tape. The bottle they want to kick back with after a long day in the vineyards. The result? It’s bold. It’s fruity. It’s a very modern Spanish red that goes with anything, especially spicy barbecue meats or anything chargrilled.",

Such care and attention usually adds up to a big price tag, but this is a real steal. The lengthy ageing process makes for a flavoursome wine with both fresh and dried-fruit flavours.

It’s an enclave of quality in Malbec-hotspot Mendoza, with wines commanding high prices. But because of convoluted wine shipping laws we can only label it as generic ‘Mendoza’ Malbec – so you get it for an absolute steal. Because this is a really fantastic quality wine. It’s made with grapes from vineyards at seriously high altitude – over 3500 feet above sea level. It means the flavours become concentrated in the intense sun, but the nightly temperature drop keeps it fresh and silky. It’s packed with red berry fruity flavours – strawberries and cherries – with a pretty, violet-like aroma. Soft and approachable, it’s perfect with chargrilled vegetables. Characteristics: Violet, Black Fruit, Red Fruit, Ripe Fruit Style: Soft & Fruity",

    "description": "Medium-bodied white wine from Sauvignon Blanc in Loire. Dry with high acidity. Characteristics: pure fruity flavour, elegant, long finish, flinty minerality, crisp and zingy. Flavor notes: citrus, blackcurrant leaf, gooseberry, ripe apple. Eric Marchant spent his childhood in his father Pierre’s vineyards, observing and helping where he could. His inherited love of the land led him to study viticulture, and since 1998, along with the help of his brother Pascal, he makes wines combining traditional and modern practices. Their vines have an average age of 25 years, allowing grapes to ripen with greater complexity, and their minimal intervention approach means the resulting wines have deliciously pure fruity flavour. This has aromatic notes of citrus, blackcurrant leaf and gooseberry. The finish is elegant and long with hints of flinty minerality and ripe apple. Its crisp and zingy character makes it a great choice for a goat’s cheese and apple salad. Characteristics: Green Apple, Smoke, Stone Fruit, Vanilla Style: Ripe & Rounded",

His adventurous nature has led him to explore the production of a duo of red wines from his family estate in Valpolicella. This silky red is crafted from just eight hectares of vines, spending between 18-24 months ageing in large oak barrels and further ageing in bottle at the estate. And, like all Pieropan wines produced since 2015, it's certified organic. Expect a soft and smooth wine, with complex flavours of red cherry, wild strawberry, and hints of spice.

Very few estates attempt to make rosé from this robust, full-flavoured grape, but Kanonkop have perfected the art.

Everything is focussed on quality. It’s made using grapes from at least fifty-year-old vines – some are even a hundred years old. Such age means that the yield of grapes from each vine is tiny – and the flavours are really concentrated. Part of it is aged in oak to give it some good structure, but it’s still a really juicy, fresh wine. It was made to be really easy-drinking – and it really does slip down oh-so-easily. It’s packed with brambly fruit flavours. Blackberry. Cherry. A hint of vanilla and spice. This style of Carignan is absolutely delicious with roast pork or a meaty chicken casserole.

The mature vines make for an intensely flavoured, complex wine. Despite the region’s hot and dry climate, it's also incredibly elegant. And unlike neighbouring Ribera Del Duero, Toro wines don't demand the same price tag – making this fine wine even more extraordinary.

In the right hands, hard-working vines create complex and intensely flavoured wines. El Picaro translates as 'the rogue', which perfectly sums up this vibrant, charming wine.

But while Barolo and Brunello have been around for centuries – even millennia – Amarone has only existed since 1938. How has it reached equal renown so quickly? In short: Amarone is unique. It’s made using dried grapes. That’s standard practice for sweet wines. as it reduces the water volume in the grapes, upping the percentage of sugar. But Amarone ferments the grapes to dryness, meaning it’s got a lot of alcohol, a lot of viscosity – and a lot of flavour. It makes for a seriously opulent wine. Plush. Layered with both fresh and dried-fruit flavours. There really is nothing quite like it. Fantastic with braised meat and aged cheese like Parmesan or Pecorino.

No wonder when he pioneered high-altitude Malbec in the Argentine Andes. Before that, Argentina was only seen as a producer of cheap bulk wine. The Catena’s changed all that. Nicolás’ great-grandfather, Nicola, planted his first Malbec vines in 1902. Since then, the family have amassed a collection of Malbec varietals which are exclusive to them. It makes the Catena’s wines completely distinct from other Argentine Malbecs. Bold. Ripe. Fruity. It’s a big wine with lots of flavour – and a lovely plush texture. It’s crying out for grilled meats – think barbecued steak with a punchy chimichurri sauce. Delicious. Characteristics: Black Fruit, Red Fruit, Ripe Fruit, Violet Style: Soft & Fruity",

This is made from 100% Chenin Blanc vines planted in the 1970s. It's wonderfully balanced with both freshness and complexity, thanks to barrel fermentation. It’s a lushly fragrant wine – think orange blossom, pear, caramel and spice. There’s plenty of mouth-watering acidity, too, which means it will cut through creamy sauces with aplomb.

Most importantly, the red Burgundy they make on this Premier Cru is exceptional. It has aromas of strawberry, raspberry, toast and oak and rich, smooth tannins. Try it with duck breast now or cellar for up to 12 years. Characteristics: Dried Herbs, Raspberry, Savoury, Strawberry Style: Light & Elegant",

    "description": "Full-bodied white wine from Chardonnay in Burgundy. Dry with medium acidity. Characteristics: opulent, buttery, expressive, great-value. Flavor notes: citrus, white chocolate, hazelnut, caramel, lemon, peach, vanilla. Maison Edouard Delaunay has a rich history dating back to 1893. Its wines were the choice of The Orient Express and the finest restaurants in France. A century later, it fell out of family hands. That was until Edouard’s great-grandson, Laurent, bought it back. He re-established his deep-rooted family connections with the best local grape-growers, and has more than succeeded in restoring the name of Edouard Delaunay to its former glory. This great-value, barrel-aged Chardonnay is an fantastic example of his efforts. This is opulent and buttery white Burgundy. Discover expressive notes of citrus, white chocolate and hazelnut. Enjoy it with an equally indulgent lobster dish.\n\nThis wine scored 92 points from Decanter for the 2020 vintage. Characteristics: Wet Stones, Caramel, Lemon, Peach, Vanilla Style: Ripe & Rounded",

He realised that the cool, rainy winters and hot, dry summers combined with Pacific breezes to make it an ideal area to grow grapes. He was the first to plant French varieties there – and it's safe to say his gamble paid off. Today, Errazuriz is regarded as a world-class winery with an array of awards in their trophy cabinet. This smooth and juicy Pinot Noir has aromatic floral notes and fresh flavours of cherry, strawberry with hints of toasty oak.

This delicious rosé was produced by Union des Vignerons des Côtes du Rhône, the largest wine cooperative in the Southern Rhone. Their vines cover a whopping 12,000 hectares, including many of the southern Rhone's crus and villages. Because of this, they get their pick of the best grapes and don't make any compromises on quality. This rose is a classic blend of Grenache, Syrah and Cinsault that has crisp, delicate notes of red fruit and peach, and a streak of minerality. We can't think of a better pairing for shellfish.

It’s evidence that sometimes, patience wins the game. And we’ve had to wait an awful long time for this. It’s made using grapes from vines up to an extraordinary eighty years old. Vines of this age yield really tiny portions of grapes so all the flavours are intensified – you can taste it in this deeply aromatic wine. It’s nutty, rich and full with a really moreish creamy texture. It’s a heady wine, packed with the flavours of ripe yellow fruits – but it’s also nice and crisp. Think pear, quince and honey, with a citrusy backbone. This is wonderful with salty, tapas-style food like salted almonds or Serrano ham.

Up until 2010, Rasteau was an appellation known mostly for sweet, fortified wines, but winemakers like the Perrins are changing that. They make this Grenache blend from 70-year-old vines, with only a small amount of the wine being aged in oak to let its fruity flavours shine.

Flavor notes: nectarine, red apple, lemon, lime, white pepper. In recent years, there's been a huge increase of plantings of Grüner Veltliner in New Zealand. For good reason: New Zealand offers a long ripening period, allowing the aromatic grape to acheive its highest level of complexity. And Saint Clair's 'Pioneer Block' series works only with the best vineyards. So you can be sure you're tasting the best Gruner that New Zealand has to offer. Complex. Elegant. A fusion of stone fruit and spice with gentle aromas of nectarine and red apple. Divine with spicy curries. Characteristics: Lemon, Lime, Red Apple, White Pepper Style: Fresh & Elegant",

Medalla Real was created to celebrate Francisco García Huidobro, an ancestor of the winery’s founders. He established the first Mint in Chile and had a medal coined to commemorate his innovation. Mature vines are used to create this complex wine. Grapes are slow-ripening thanks to cool night-time temperatures, allowing concentrated flavours to develop before picking. The end result is powerful but elegant. It has intense aromas of blackcurrant, blueberry and cherry, combined with soft cedar and spice. It's supple and juicy with a long, lingering finish. Delicious with steak in pepper sauce. The 2020 vintage was awarded 90 points by Tim Atkin MW, and 90 points by James Suckling.

This Chardonnay hails from Uco Valley in Mendoza, where plots are 1250 metres above sea level. At these altitudes, the natural acidity and freshness of the grapes are retained. The cool night-time temperatures also slow down the ripening process, helping concentrate flavours. These conditions make for less interaction when it comes to the winemaking process – the natural expression of the grapes is allowed to shine. The end result is an elegant and deeply refreshing style of Chardonnay. Expect white peach, papaya and citrus. Gentle oak ageing shows in subtle toasty notes of hazelnut and vanilla.

    "description": "Medium-bodied red wine from Pinot Noir in Marlborough. Dry with medium acidity and low tannins. Characteristics: fruity, silky, savory. Flavor notes: raspberry, strawberry, red plum, black cherry. Marlborough Pinot Noir is a bit of an unsung gem. It’s often overshadowed by its regional sister, Sauvignon Blanc – but we think it’s fantastic if you love deeply fruity, silky reds. This is from the Southern Valleys, the prime spot for pernickety Pinot Noir which needs very specific soil and climate conditions to thrive. The grapes ripen slowly, developing really concentrated, berry-fruit flavours which are a trademark of the Marlborough style. Added to which, Brent Marris is the master of Marlborough – he knows how to get the very best out of his grapes in these famous valleys. It’s a real corker of the wine. Ripe. Juicy. Fruity. It’s full of raspberry, strawberry and red plum flavours, with a nicely savoury quality and silky texture. Perfect with slow-cooked beef ragu.\n\nIn 2022, this wine won an IWC award for the 2020 vintage.

    "description": "Light-bodied white wine from Sauvignon Blanc in Marlborough. Dry with high acidity. Characteristics: elegant, restrained, complex, unique, textured. Flavor notes: tropical fruits, green pepper, citrus, elderflower, flint-mineral. Peter Vavasour founded his winery in the 1980s. It was the very first in Marlborough’s sub-region of the Awatere Valley, and so the team had the pick of the best spots for growing the finest grapes. His plan was to make elegant, restrained styles of wine, like the Sauvignon Blancs of the Loire and Bordeaux. The team have more than succeeded with this one – and now those original vines are some of the oldest in the region, it shows even greater complexity and unique character. It’s beautifully textured, with vibrant notes of tropical fruits, green pepper and citrus. A delicate note of elderflower and a flint-mineral finish adds to its elegance. Such a mouthwatering wine will be perfect for crumbly goat’s cheese. Characteristics: Citrus Fruit, Elderflower, Gooseberry, Passionfruit Style: Crisp & Zesty",

The grape has been documented here since the 14th century. It’s said that Venetian grapegrowers brought it with them upon fleeing to the countryside during the Plague. Between the Apennine Mountains and the Adriatic Sea, cool and breezy hillsides offer the perfect environment for citrusy, high-acidity Verdicchio. Wines from the high-altitude Castelli di Jesi appellation are known for their refreshing, minerally character. If you’re a fan of Gavi or Chablis, this organic bottling makes a fantastic alternative choice. It’s versatile thanks to rich, zesty flavours and crisp acidity.

    "description": "Medium-bodied white wine from Chardonnay in France. Dry with high acidity. Characteristics: structured, textured, exquisite, fresh, complex. Flavor notes: ripe lemon, rye bread, smokiness, pear, almond, biscuit, green apple. Veuve Clicquot is one of the most popular Champagne brands in the world, and its success is largely down to one woman: Barbe-Nicole Clicquot-Ponsardin. Madame Clicquot's innovative thinking saw her invent winemaking techniques that are still used in Champagne today. So it's no wonder her influence earned her the title of 'La Grande Dame de la Champagne'. This Pinot Noir-dominant cuvée was created in 1972 to honour the 'Great Lady' – and to also celebrate the bicentenary of the house. Madame Clicquot believed that Pinot Noir had the broadest range of expression and potential to create the best Champagnes. Veuve's current cellar master, Didier Mariotti, wholeheartedly agrees and the grape now accounts for up to 90 percent of the blend. He sums up this prestigious wine as  ‘structured and textured’. With such exquisite flavour and complexity, we’re certain you’ll find popping its cork a memorable event. Expect fine bubbles that are delicately creamy, with lively notes of ripe lemon, rye bread and a hint of smokiness. Its incredibly fresh, making every sip mouthwatering. Italian artist and ceramicist Paola Paronetto is behind the label and packaging design of the 2015 vintage. Her love of colour is reflected in the vast array of eye-catching cases.

But we didn’t want to settle for just any old wine. We challenged our buyers to find the very best wine they could at this price point. And they don’t do things by halves. They tasted more than fifty Pinot Grigios before they settled on this as the very best quality for the money. We think they hit the nail on the head. It’s citrussy. It’s peachy. It’s got lovely crisp apple flavours – and it’s really refreshing. All you could want from an Italian Pinot Grigio.

This wine has all that in spades – but it also has a little something extra. It’s from Val do Salnés, is the oldest sub-region of Rías Baxias right on the coast. It’s known as the birthplace of the Albariño grape – and it’s the coolest and wettest part of the region. It means the Albariños from here are extra crisp and green-fruity. They age this on the lees which gives the wine even more complexity and a lovely viscous texture which works incredibly with all those zingy, citrussy flavours. It’s a really special, unusual Albariño which is perfect if you love both crisp whites and richer styles of wine. But there’s a catch. Only 1,100 cases of this wine were made – so be quick. It’ll be ideal alongside a seafood platter. Characteristics: Wet Stones, Apricot, Bread Dough, Lemon, Peach Style: Rich & Toasty",

    "description": "Light-bodied red wine from Nebbiolo in Piedmont. Dry with medium acidity and low tannins. Characteristics: elegant, savory, silk-smooth, concentrated, complex. Flavor notes: plum, blackberry, spice, dried herbs. The Voerzio brothers were part of the Barolo Boys, an iconic generation of winemakers that changed the world of Barolo wine. Gianni Voerzio's son, Mirko, today continues with their work. To create the most concentrated Barolo, he strictly limits the yields in the vineyard, allowing just 1kg of grapes per vine. It's no-expense-spared winemaking, and the benefits show in this bottle. Expect notes of plum, blackberry, spice and dried herbs and silk-smooth tannins, thanks to a very long ageing process. Drink now with grilled lamb, or cellar it for another 10 years. Monica Lamer gave the 2017 vintage 92 Parker Points. Characteristics: Cigar Box, Rose, Savoury, Strawberry Style: Light & Elegant",

It's from the Douro – a hot, dry region best known for producing robust, full-bodied wines, including Port. So how is this wine so light, crisp and refreshing? It's down to winemaker Luís Sottomayor. He carefully chooses grapes from high-altitude vineyards where the temperatures are cool and yields are low. So vines produce grapes full of freshness and intense flavour. It’s full of tropical and zingy citrus flavours. Something this refreshing and aromatic cries out for grilled octopus with chilli and lime.

It’s made with grapes affected by the coveted ‘noble rot’, which results in grapes shrivelling on the wine and becoming exceptionally sweet.

This results in fizz with complex creamy and spicy flavours. To make the highly-esteemed Special Cuvée, grapes are predominately picked from Grand Cru and Premier Cru vineyards. And if that wasn't luxurious enough, the wine is then aged for double the legal requirement, so expect nothing less than excellence in every sip. Rich. Ripe. Powerful.

Flavor notes: juicy pear, citrus, honeysuckle, green apple, red apple, wet stones, hint of spice. Pinot Grigio continues to be one the UK’s most favoured wines. But did you know the grape can be found on home turf? In England it’s referred to as Pinot Gris, just like in France, where the grape originates from. It’s not a common planting here, and you’ll find few estates make it better than Bolney – one of the oldest wineries in the country. 2022 marks 50 years of winemaking for founders Janet and Rodney Pratt, and daughter Sam, who has followed in their pioneering footsteps. This Pinot Gris was the first English still wine to be served at Wimbledon, and it doesn’t get more British than that. Ripe. Rounded. Silky. It has lively aromas of juicy pear, citrus and honeysuckle. A hint of spice and plenty of freshness makes it a delicious pairing for sushi.

The Assyrtiko vineyards used to make this are between 50 and 70 years old – and it’s believed that a few vines may have been growing for up to 180 years. And it’s not just the vines that claim an impressive heritage. The two winemakers behind White Ash have worked across the Greek wine industry for decades to hone their knowledge and expertise. It’s aged for over a year on the lees (yeast cells) to give it more body and complexity. So along with the incredible depth of flavour that comes from old vines, you’re in for a seriously impressive and unique wine. Expect aromas of citrus and peach, combined with lively minerality thanks to volcanic soils. There’s a hint of honey alongside fresh-fruit flavours.

    "description": "Full-bodied white wine from Sauvignon Blanc in Stellenbosch. Dry with high acidity. Characteristics: rich, rounded, elegant, complex. Flavor notes: elderflower, citrus, white peach, tropical fruit, gooseberry, melon, passionfruit, pineapple. Rustenberg has a wine-growing history dating back to 1682. Today, the estate is managed by Simon Barlow with his son, Murray, who heads up the winemaking. Murray’s wines are some of Stellenbosch’s finest, and he has rightfully won not just a cult following, but heaps of critical praise. In fact, he is the only winemaker to win Young Winemaker of the Year twice at South Africa’s biggest wine awards event, Diners Club. The grapes for this Sauvignon are plucked from mountainous south-west facing vines, so they get maximum sun exposure. And thanks to six months of barrel-ageing, the resulting wine is rich, rounded and full of flavour. The 2022 vintage was awarded 93 Points by James Suckling – what’s more, it was his highest ranked South African wine in his ‘Top 100 Best Value Wines of 2022’ list at number 30. It has refreshing notes of elderflower, citrus, white peach and tropical fruit. Delicious with tempura prawns.

Flavor notes: pear, mango, honeysuckle, quince, apricot, toasty brioche. Pol Roger was known to be Churchill’s favourite fizz, and it’s also the Champagne of choice for royal weddings. 33 metres below street level, Pol Roger’s cellars are three degrees cooler than other cellars in the region – a tiny variation which makes all the difference. It slows the fermentation right down, which intensifies flavours and creates extra-fine, elegant bubbles. After four years of ageing, this Brut Réserve is well worth the wait. You’ll find aromas of pear, mango and honeysuckle, with ripe and developed flavours of quince, apricot and toasty brioche. The richness is balanced by a crisp, refreshing acidity.

Slightly reminiscent of Pouilly-Fumé. An excellent apéritif, this will also go with summery salads. Drink young. Characteristics: Wet Stones, Citrus Fruit, Elderflower Style: Crisp & Zesty",

The results were so great, they’ve followed the same principles ever since, creating something similar to the Rhône Valley’s infamous Condrieu – without the price tag.

Rioja is all about the oak ageing – so it’s strange to think that back in 1900 most wineries sold their wines as soon as possible. But the brothers changed this – creating an incredible ageing capacity of 80,000 bottles in their new winery. This Reserva reflects that focus on ageing. Rich. Warm. Vanilla-spiced. It’s aged in oak barrels for 50% longer than it legally needs to be, giving it more finesse, more coconut spice, more softness. It’s delicious – ideal with roast lamb or Spanish-style beef steaks.\n\nIn 2022, this wine won an IWC award for the 2017 vintage.

Pagos del Rey was founded in 2002, with the goal of crafting quality wines in Spain’s most prestigious winemaking regions. This rich Ribera del Duero proves that they’ve succeeded. It’s made with both old- and young-vine Tempranillo grapes, which are fermented separately to preserve their individual characters. The young-vine grapes give bright fruit and floral aromas, while the old-vine parcel provides firm tannins and riper fruit notes. The wine is then aged in oak for 409 days, hence its name, followed by several months in bottle. All that attention to detail has paid off – this 2020 vintage was awarded an excellent 92 points from top critic James Suckling. Discover juicy dark-fruit flavours balanced by complex notes of toasted spices, dark chocolate, walnut and tobacco.

The world’s most award-winning winery in 2021, Purcari have bagged 333 gold and silver medals across a huge number of influential wine competitions. But they’re not just some young upstart. An imperial Russian decree in 1827 granted Purcari status as the first specialised winery in Bessarabia. In 1847 they won their first medal and in 1878 snagged gold at the Paris World Fair – a trend that would continue. This ruby-hued number made from local Rară Neagră grapes has pure fruit aromas of sour cherry, blackcurrant and plum, and hints of spice. A satiny texture with every sip, too. Think of it as Moldova’s take on a classic Rhône red. Characteristics: Black Fruit, Cocoa, Sweet Spice Style: Bold & Spicy",

Venetians are just crazy about Prosecco – but not just any old fizz. They know the good stuff when they taste it, and they demand the very best. Our buyers tasted countless Proseccos to try and find the perfect union of flavour and value, but we couldn’t quite find what we were looking for. So, we decided to commission it. Aqualta was the result, made exclusively for us – and we think it’s the perfect Prosecco. It’s fragrant with really delicate aromas of apple and pear. The style’s typical of the super-fresh fizz served in backstreet bàcari; used to top up Venice’s signature spritzes, or chase a groaning table of cichèti. It’s a mouthwatering slice of Italy at home.

    "description": "Light-bodied white wine from Macabeo in Catalunya. Dry with high acidity. Characteristics: delicate, balanced, complex. Flavor notes: apple, pear, citrus, apricot, melon, bread, cream. A big name in Cava, Vallformosa has been making Spain’s signature fizz since the 1930s, and they've racked up plenty of awards along the way. And yet the team – headed by winemaker Xavi Pons – doesn’t rest on its laurels. Since the early 2000s they’ve been focused on both environmental and social sustainability, using fewer natural resources and supporting a network of 500 long-term local growers. The attention to detail hasn’t shifted, and all wines are aged for longer than the legal requirement, bringing more complex flavour to your glass. This is delicate, balanced fizz with bright notes of apple, pear and citrus. Characteristics: Apricot, Bread, Cream, Green Apple, Melon, Pear Style: Crisp & Fruity",

    "description": "Full-bodied white wine from Chardonnay in Western Cape. Dry with high acidity. Characteristics: elegant, sophisticated, mineral. Flavor notes: grapefruit, lemon peel, vanilla, cinnamon, toasted hazelnut. The Rothschild family’s winemaking legacy began in 1868, when James de Rothschild bought the prestigious Château Lafite in Bordeaux. Over a century later, his great-grandson Baron Edmond decided to take his passion and expertise to South Africa. There, in partnership with businessman and philanthropist Dr Anton Rupert, he began producing French-style wines in picturesque Franschhoek. The estate is now managed by the next generation of both families – and the wines continue to attract international acclaim. This Chardonnay was named in honour of Baron Edmond’s wife, Baroness Nadine de Rothschild. And with its elegance and sophistication, it’s a fitting tribute. Discover notes of grapefruit and lemon peel, plus hints of vanilla, cinnamon and toasted hazelnut. Its citrusy character and long, mineral finish make it an ideal match for fish and seafood dishes.

A clos is a walled vineyard. Only a handful of Champagne houses – notably Krug – own one. To make Clos du Moulin, three vintages are carefully selected for their ability to age gracefully. After 8 years maturing in the cellar, the resulting wine reflects the unique origin of the grapes. It’s rich and generous with endless notes of citrus, orchard fruits, melon, ripe red berries and frangipane. Hints of caramel and spice add to its long finish.

Passed down from fathers to sons, their vineyards have been extensively developed over the years. Fast forward to today, they have 50 plots spread across some of the best terroirs in the region. With the aim of producing wines that showcase the best of the region, their pursuit of quality has led to considerable winery renovations. They’ve even built their facilities into the hillsides, where grapes are pumped by gravity. And the reduction of human interaction results in a truly pure expression of the wines. This has classic Loire Sauvignon flavours of green apple, lively citrus and ripe stone fruits, with herby hints and a fresh, mineral finish. Its crisp acidity makes it a delicious apéritif or an ideal pairing for seafood and smoked fish.",

Decades on, Jean-Fernand’s sons and nephew now make up the team, having gained a wealth of winemaking experience from around the world, ranging from South America to neighbouring Sancerre. This Sauvignon has previously received high praise from Decanter, and as of the 2022 vintage, the winery will be officially certified as organic. It’s lively and aromatic, with notes of white peach, pear and a touch of mint. Expect flavours of orange zest and orchard fruit, plus a streak of chalky minerality reminiscent of Pouilly-Fumé.

    "description": "Light-bodied red wine from Pinot Noir in Martinborough. Dry with high acidity. Characteristics: complex, elegant, juicy. Flavor notes: raspberry, cherry, pomegranate, black cherry, blackberry. The picturesque town of Martinborough is the winery hub of New Zealand’s Wairarapa region. In 1996, having quit well-paid city jobs, Margaret and Tim Coney bought a paddock here. After dismissing several flocks of sheep, they set about planting the 16-hectare plot with 10,000 vines. Armed only with spades, this marked the beginning of their commitment to craft wines with a natural, hands-on approach. Martinborough’s cool climate is similar to that of Burgundy, so Pinot Noir thrives here. Pizzicato proves this time and again, having scooped awards for several of its vintages. Complex and elegant, it has juicy notes of raspberry, cherry and pomegranate. Plenty of fruity flavour and fresh acidity make it a wonderful choice for rich lamb dishes.

It’s a really modern style, made from a single plot of their oldest vines. They have an average age of 30 years old, so yields are low – and fewer grapes mean more concentrated flavour. Bright.

The grapes for this mature claret are sourced from a single plot of old vines overlooking the Gironde estuary, on the finest gravel soils. Here, brothers Frédéric and Edouard employ innovative winemaking techniques, ageing their wines in large oak foudres instead of traditional oak barriques. Their blends have a reputation for concentration and excellent ageability. And with over 10 years of age, this 2011 vintage is remarkably complex. Ripe. Structured. Rounded. It has perfumed notes of blackcurrant, blueberry and spice, great texture and a long finish. Its subtle savoury character will pair well with rich meat dishes such as beef, lamb or venison.

Grapes are estate-grown and bottled from a collection of just 9 family-owned vineyards. Vines thrive in this area thanks to the unique climate. Warm winds blow in from the Adriatic sea, meeting the cooler air flowing down from the Majela mountains. The locals refer to the resulting valley breeze as ‘brezza di terra’ – and it’s this that encourages perfect grape ripening. This is a beautifully floral, refreshing wine with stone fruit and citrus flavours. It’s excellent with fresh white fish and a squeeze of lemon.

    "description": "Full-bodied red wine from Shiraz in Australia. Dry with medium acidity and medium tannins. Characteristics: complex, structured, savory. Flavor notes: black cherry, black pepper, blackcurrant, liquorice, smoke, spice. Cape Mentelle is one of Margaret River’s 'founding five' wineries. A benchmark for quality, they're celebrated for having pioneered many of this Western Australian wine region's renowned styles. Despite other grape varieties often taking the limelight, Shiraz really flourishes here. A cooler coastal influence results in a more restrained style than the bold-and-jammy Shiraz of Barossa and Mclaren Vale. In a nod towards the traditional Syrah blends of the Rhône Valley's Côte-Rôtie, winemaker Eloise Jarvis blends her red Shiraz grapes with white Viognier to dial up the complexity. Viognier is rich and aromatic, so adding it to a blend brings freshness, softens tannins, and enhances any fruity and floral notes. Côte-Rôtie wines usually come with lofty prices, but this Cape Mentelle favourite means you can enjoy the style at a fraction of the cost. Expect a complex and structured wine with layers of violets, dark forest fruits and wild cherries. Intense savoury notes of tobacco, leather and spice mean this wine matches well with simple grilled meats or rich vegetable-laden stews.

So it’s surprising that 50% of Chassagne Montrachet is planted with Pinot Noir. Few producers make red wine here, and given its lesser-known existence, they can offer fantastic value for money. Domaine Bader-Mimeur brings us one such wine. The family bought the historical vineyard of Château de Chassagne-Montrachet in 1919 and have been pioneering first-class Pinot Noir ever since. The 2015 vintage saw a very dry and sunny summer, resulting in grapes full of concentrated flavour. And since vines are between 50 to 75 years old, you can expect a deliciously complex wine. Discover notes of ripe red fruits including raspberry and Kirsch cherry, earthy savoury notes and peppery spice. Stored correctly, this will continue to develop until 2030.

With an aim to create the purest expression of Saint-Émilion, Château Fonplégade recruited one of the world's most sought-after winemaking consultants and made the change to entirely organic farming. Predominantly Merlot with just enough Cabernet Franc to add structure, this blend is made from hand-picked grapes from their oldest vines. It’s aged for 16-20 months in a variety of amphora, concrete vessels and oak barrels, adding complex flavours and texture. It’s full bodied and plush, with notes of blackcurrant, blueberry, cocoa and tobacco and a long, smooth finish. A dream pairing for a rich cassoulet.

Flavor notes: black fruits, spice, leather, vanilla. The CVNE winery is one of the most iconic in Rioja. Founded in 1879, it's now in its third generation of family ownership. This classic Gran Reserva is made under their ever-popular Cune brand. The team use grapes from old vines – 45 years old, on average – which ensures the flavours are superbly concentrated. It’s aged for two years in oak, then spends at least three years in CVNE’s cellars to really dial up the complexity. Expect flavours of black fruits, spice and leather, with subtle vanilla notes and firm tannins. The wine will continue to develop in the bottle, but if you can’t wait to try it, its richness and structure are a perfect match for stews and casseroles.

They were pioneers of Bordeaux varietals in the Cape, producing Bordeaux-style blends with a unique South African flair. Meerlust means ‘pleasure of the sea’, as the vineyards are refreshed by ocean breezes and evening mists which roll in from the coast. This allows the grapes to ripen slowly, developing complex flavours but retaining freshness too. Produced from decades-old vines, this complex Merlot is aged for 18 months in oak before it’s released. Its intense flavour and structure means it can age for up to another decade or more – so it’s no surprise leading critic Tim Atkin awarded it 91 points. Expect opulent notes of ripe bramble fruits, dark chocolate and spice. Its silky tannins and rich flavours make it a great match for red meats.",

Flavor notes: ripe black cherry, forest floor, cinnamon spice, leather. Despite the label, you can consider this bottle to be a Chianti Rufina Reserva DOCG – Chianti’s most northerly subzone – and the area renowned for making the region’s most long lived wines. Sat in the foothills of the Apennine mountains, vines here benefit from warm sunny days followed by cool nights. The huge changes in temperature results in wines with intense aromas and plenty of fresh acidity – and it’s this acidity that gives them their lengthy ageing potential. Due to a change in production rules in the 1980s, the prestigious Grato family can’t label this bottling a Chianti Rufina. They keep back some of their best cuvées, ageing them for longer than the DOCG panel allows. It means they become what's known as a declassified wine, but don’t let that fool you into thinking this is anything less than a first-rate Tuscan red. Predominantly Sangiovese, the blend spent 30 months in oak barrels, followed by further ageing in tank and bottle before release. Discover intense notes of ripe black cherry and forest floor, with hints of cinnamon spice and leather. It has a silky and savoury character with mellowed tannins, making it a delicious choice for roasted game. Characteristics: Cinnamon, Cooked Fruit, Leather, Spice Style: Savoury & Full Bodied",

Their wines are reminiscent of Condrieu, the finest and most expensive expression of Viognier, but come without the usual price tag.
